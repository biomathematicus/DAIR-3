GENERAL INSTRUCTIONS  The Pre Ambulatory Bloo d Pressure ( BAP) form is completed du ring the participants baseline clinic visit to  document the process of applying the ambulatory blood pres sure monitor to be wo rn by the participant for 24 hours following the baseline clinic visit. The techni cian must be certified with training in the proper operation a nd application of the A mbulator y Blood Pressure Monitor (APBM). The technician should have a wo rking knowledge of Manual 4: Blood Pressure. The technician shou ld be fam iliar with the data entry procedures for electronic form versions and under stand the document titled General Instructions for Compl eting Paper  Forms  prior to compl eting this form. ID Number, Contact Year and name should be completed as described in that document. Initiate the process by pr oviding the partici pant with ABPM instructions.   II. SPE CIFIC INSTRUCT IONS  A. Introduction  1. Give the participant the two handouts: Participant Information: Ambulatory Blood Pressure Monitoring (ABPMR 1) and Participant Information: Removing and Repos itioning Am bulat ory Blood Pressure Monitor (ABPMR2). Circle Y to indicate that  the information han douts were given to the parti cipant.   2. Provide verbal instructions for wearing, removing and repositioning the ABPM. Details of the participant in struction for the use of the ABPM is given in TAB E, section 5 of Manual 4: Blood Pressure.  Stress that the monitor should be worn for the entire  24-hour period without removal if at all poss ible. Ensure that the parti cipant has an opportunity to ask questions. Circle Y to indicate this  instruction was provided.   3. The intent of this item is to obtai n commitme nt from the participant to wear the ABPM according to the instructions.  If the participa nt does not agree go Item 23.  4. Record the date of application of the monitor using leading zeroes as needed. Th is should b e the same date as the Clin ic Exam unless the participant is unable to complete this pr ocedure in the follo wing 24 hours.  The participant may request that th is procedure be performed within the BAPA QxQ 02 -23-2001   1 next 30 days.  5. Record the serial number of t he ABPM use d for this participant.   6. Place the ABPM on t he participants arm givi ng preference to the non-dominant arm, marking either L or  R arm as appropriate.  The non-dominant arm is opposite to that arm used for most activities such as writing or holding a fork.  The dominant  arm can be used if there i s some reason precluding use of the non-dominant arm, or on participant request. If the non-dominant arm is used, reas ons will be recorded in Item 17a and b, below.  7. Using the tape measure, measur e the forearm midway between the shoulder and the elbow of the non-dom inant  arm. Choose the appropriate cuff based on this measure.  Circle the letter corresponding to the cuff chosen for the participant.  8. Record the ABPM ID Number used fo r this participant.  This number is displayed on the computer screen and links the participant with the data to be collected over the next 24 hours.   B. Correlation  9-13. Correlation  is a procedure to ensure that the ABPM  measures are accurate measures of blood pres sure as correlated with the mercury sphygmomanometer.  The pr ocedure consists of five blood pressure readings ta ken from the ABPM and mercury sphygmomanometer simultaneously.  These are recorded on the form with space allocated for systolic and diastolic meas ures from each d evice. The instructions for this procedure are detailed in Manua l 4: Blood Pressure, TAB D.  For the first measure (#1), record the results of t he Sphygmomanometer systolic blood pressure (SBP) in 9a and diastolic blood pressure (DBP) in 9b.  The SBP and DBP taken from the ABPM are recorded in 9c and 9d, respectively.  Repeat the correlation fo r a total of 5 readings recording the results in Items 10-13.  Reject the measures with the highest and lowest diastolic reading (taken either by sphygmomanom eter or ABPM). Circle the R for reject corresponding to the two rejected readings  (9e-13e).  C ircle the A for the 3 accepted readings.    14. Calcu late a nd record the mean of the accepted SBP an d DBP mea sures in the appropriate bo xes (14a-14d).  This will be done a utomatically by computer if using the DES version of the form.  The mean of the 3 BAPA QxQ 02 -23-2001   2 accepted sphygmomanometer diastolic  read ings (14b) and the 3 ABPM diastolic readings (14d) ma y not differ by more that  +/- 7 mm Hg.  If the difference exceeds seven then the par ticipant should be excluded from ABPM.  If excluded, go  to item 18.  C. Completion  15. Using a 24- hour clock (e.g., 12 noon is 1200, 1:15 PM is 1315, and so forth), enter the time monitoring begun.   This time is displayed on the computer screen.  16. Answer the question by circling Y or N.  If the non-dom inant arm is used go to item 18.   17. Circle the answer that describes why the non-dominant  arm was not used.  If the answer other is selected, please expla in why the non-dominant arm was not used in the note boxes provided in 17b.  18. This item is intended to confirm t hat the correlation procedure defined the participant as eligible and the partici pant agrees to proceed with ABPM. If answered Yes, go to item 20.  19. If the participant will not proceed wit h the ABPM procedure, specify the reason the procedure is not completed.  For refusal or other, specify the explic it reason in the note boxed prov ided in 19b, and continue to Item 23.   20. This item verifies t hat an appointment has been m ade for the return of the ABPM. Exp licit details of the time and mode of return are recorded on the 24-Hour Sample Pick-Up checklist (TFP) for m.  21. Fill in the date scheduled for retrieval of the ABPM.  22. Circle P if the participant will retu rn the ABPM to the JHS Exam Center or C if a JHS representative will pick up the ABPM. Exp licit details of where the ABPM will be picked u p (hom e, work or other) are recorded on the TFP for m.   D. Administrative Information  23.

ID Number, Contact Y ear and Name should be completed as described in that document. Initiate the process by providin g the participant wit h PAM instructio ns.  II. SPE CIFIC INSTRUCT IONS  1. Record the date of application of t he monitor using leading zeroes as needed.  This should be the same date as t he baseline clinic exam unless the participant is unable to complete this pr ocedure in the follo wing 24 hours.  The participant may request that this procedure be performed within the next 30 days.  2. Give the participant the handouts : Part icipant Information: Physical Activity Monitor and Instructions for Wearing St ep Counter. Circle Y to indicate that the information handouts were given to the participant.   3. Provide verbal instructions for wear ing, removing and repositioning the PAM.  Stress that the CSA monitor and step c ounter should be worn for the entire 24-hour period without  removal except  while bathing or swimming.   Open the pouch containing t he CSA monitor and take it out to show the participant. Also open the step counter so th e participant can see the display.   Briefly review the procedure with the parti cipant, allowing her or him to look at the handout.  Say to the par ticipant, In order to  get more accurate information about your physical activity and how  your activity is related to your health, we are asking you to wear this ac tivity monitor and the step counter at your waist for the next 24 hours. You wil l wear both the step counter and the activity monitor on this belt. The ac tivity monitor contains electronic BPAA QxQ 02 -23-2001   1 equipment that detects vibr ations from your movem ent.  It will store a number every minute indicating the time of day and how much vibration it detects.  It does not detect or store any other info rmation. You need to wear it snugly at your waist so it can detect your move ment.  Do you hav e any questions about the activity monitor?  Give the parti cipant an opportunity to ask any questions  s/he may h ave.  Then say to the participant, The step counter detects movement when you are walking around and displays a total count  of all the steps it detects.  You also need to wear it snugly at your wa ist so it can detect your movement accurately. Do you hav e any questions about the step counter?  Then say to the participant, This equipment  does not require any specia l attention from you. R eview the instru ctions at the lowe r part of the handout with the participant.  E mphasize that it  is very important not to open the activity monitor because the electronics can be easily damaged.   Some participants may ask about what will b e done with  the data or how active they should try to be.  Except  for any restrictions due to ABPM, the participant should do their usual activiti es.  The belt wit h the monitor can be removed when the participant goes to sleep,  bathes, or i f s/he wants to swim or be involv ed in another activity that would likely cause the monitor to get wet. Explain that the dat a in the monitor will be downlo aded to a computer when it is returned to the clinic.  If the participant asks, you c an tell her or him that s/he will not be able to see the result s of the monitoring from this visit.  The information about  his or her activi ty will be combin ed with all the other health infor mation.  If the participant asks how many steps ar e healthy or g ood, explain that the number of steps will b e different for people d epend ing o n how much walking they do.  This part of t he JHS will help researchers learn if a certai n number of steps by men and women of diff erent ages and body types seems to be related to better health.  Circle Y to indicate this  instruction was provided.   4. The intent of this item  is to obtain commitme nt from the participant to wear the CSA activit y monitor accord ing to the instructions.  5. The intent of this item  is to obtain commitme nt from the participant to wear the BPAA QxQ 02 -23-2001   2 step counter according to the directions.  6. Record the CSA monitor number (engraved on the monitor and may be printed on a small label) in the boxes. Ther e is a notch on one end on the CSA monit or.  Place the monitor in the pouch so the notch (and monitor number) is at the top.   7. Record the step counter ident ification number in the boxes.  8. The CSA monitor must be initialized to  start a new data collection file.  The staff member who initialize d the wil l have placed a colored dot on the CSA monitor marked with the date and time the monitor will start collecting data. If the colored dot is not on the monitor, look in the protecti ve pouch in case it fell off.  If you have confirmed t hat the monitor was initializ ed, circle Y for ite m 8.  If you can not confirm t hat the monitor has been in itialized for the time and date that you need it, choose a different monitor that is properly marked or have the monitor initialized by a trained st aff member before giving it to the participant.  9. This item confirms that the participant  is wearing an ABPM at the same time as the CSA and step counter.  If the par ticipant is wearing both the ABPM and  the PAM devices, synchronize the ti me between the monitors. Having the computers used to initialize the dif ferent  moni tors set to the same time does this. Circle Y if this synchroni zation procedure was completed.  10. This item confirms that  the step counter was started at 0 prior to pl acing it on the participant. Press the button to set the step counter to 0.    11. Record the time of starting the PAM in hours and minutes, circling AM or P M.   Place the CSA monit or in its protective pouch and make sure it is securely attached to the belt.

Note: If \"Before Ye sterd ay\" is cho sen in (a), sk ip to Item 6.  5. Computed Fasting Time .  This item is calculated automatically when the Fasting/Tracking Form is entered directly on the computer.  (A s a way of denoting this on the paper form, lines are provided rather than boxes for recording the result.)  To calculate the fasting time when using the paper version of the form, use the \"F asting Time Computation Table,\" which can be found on the last page of these instructions, to det ermine the time.  To use the table, look up the Time Last Consumed on the left hand column, and the current time (Time of Visit) along the top.  The value in the body of the table co rresponding to those two times is the number of hours fasted.  Note that the \"Time Last C onsumed\" is separated into \"Yesterday\" and \"Today,\" and that all times are separated by \"A M\" and \"PM.\"  In addition, times are given in one-hour intervals.  The top line in the table may be used whenever the Time Last Consumed is earlier than 7:00 PM.  This is acceptable because, although the fasting time may not be accurate, it will not be less than the critical time of 12 hours.  Note:  Computing fasting time using the table does not always provide the same result as the computer (due to a reduction in accuracy).  Ho wever, any effect arising from this fact is believed to be negligible because (1) only a small number of cases would cross over the 12-hour critical time, and (2) even in such cases, ARIC procedures call for the completion of the visit regardless of fasting time.  For example, if the Time Last Consumed is 7:30 PM yesterday (in 7-7:59 PM interval) and the Time of Visit is 8:15 AM (in 8-8:59 AM  interval), the fasting time is 13 hours.  6. Have you given blood within the last 7 days .  Read the question.  If  the response is YES, determine whether the participant gave or donated a pint of blood/plasma in contrast to had blood samples drawn.  Record YES only if \"given blood\" refers to the donation of a pint (or more) or whole blood or plasma, not a blood samp le for diagnostic evaluation.  Otherwise, record NO.  7. Record \"C\" if the form was completed on t he computerized data entry system, or \"P\" if the paper form was used.  If the form was completed partially on paper and partially on the computer, code as \"Paper Form.\"  The person at the clinic who has completed this form must enter her/his code number in the boxes provided.

GENERAL STATEMENT TO PARTICIPANTS  The statement below s hould be read to a ll participants before providing them with the Approach to Life Bring to Clinic questionnaires.   We are asking that you complete this packet of questi onnaires at  home. You should brin g these forms with you to your Clin ic Exam visit. In this packet, there are questions c overing different topics. You will read some that ask about how much support you feel from your family and fr iends . Other questions ask about how you deal with stress. We are interested in your honest answers to these questions  because we want to know more about how we cope or deal with stress relates to health in general, and particularly  heart disease.  This packet has several parts to it.  At  the beginn ing of  each part, there will b e instructions telling you how to answer t he questions. Please take your time to answer eac h question carefully. Please do not skip any questions. Remember that there are no right or w rong answers.  We  are interested in your feelings and opinions.   If you do not understand the instructions for one of the questi onnaires or do not understand one of the questions, please tell the Jackson Heart Study staff me mber when you a rrive for your Clinic Exam visit. They will be happy to help you.  Thank you for filling o ut these questionna ires.  II. CHECKING THE QUESTIONNAIRES  When reviewing/p icking up the B ring to Clin ic questionnaires, check to make sure that all items on each questionnaire were ans wered. If there are blank items, offer the participant the opportunity to complete  the item(s), and provide any assistance needed. Mr. or Mrs. (Participant), Ive notic ed that some of the qu estions were left blank. Would you mind answering these for me  now?  If the parti cipant left the items blank intent ionally, the interviewer should explain the rationale to the participant again, and reassure the partici pant about confidentiality . If the parti cipant does  feel comfortable answering the questions for so me reason, this should be noted, and the participant should be thanked for pointing out their concerns.  ISLA QxQ 0 2-22-2001   1 III. ANSWE RING PARTI CIPANTS QUESTIONS  Participant s may have questions about particular items. The interviewer should read the item again, and provide a neutral prompt, such as, Ans wer whats right for you or Answer what makes t he most sense to you.  Most of the terms used in the various ra ting scales (e.g., Almost N ever, Almost Always, Most of the Time, Rarely, etc.) are left to the parti cipants s ubjective perception of what these m ean. If the participant has a qu estion a bout the scaling on a particular questionnaire, the interviewe r should provide only neutral information, such as, U se it the way that you would no rmally use it in conversation, or, Pick the answer that is closest to what is ri ght fo r you. Remind the partici pant that there are no right or wrong ans wers to the questions, and that we are simply interested in their views.  If the participant has questions about a par ticular item or requires assistance completing the questionnaire (illiteracy or visu al deficit), keep in mind that many of these questions are quite personal, and may be perceived as sensitive or potentially embarrassing to the participant. Read all questions in a neutral, non judgmental tone. Be sure to conduct this in a manner that assures their privacy .  When the response categories ar e repetitive (such as True or False or Yes or No), and the participant appears to understand the questions and provides reasonable answers, the interviewer may choose not to read the response categories to every question.   IV. GENERAL INSTRUCTIONS  The Approach to Life Interpersonal (ISL) Form is completed by the participant as part of the Approach to Life form.   V. DETAILED INSTRUCTIONS   This scale is made up of a list of statement s, each of which may or may not be true about you.  For each statement, circle \"1\" for Definitely True if you are sure it is true about you, and \"2\" for P robably True if you think it is true but are not absolutely certain.  Similarly, you should ci rcle \"4\" for D efinitely False if you are sure the statement is false, and \"3\" for \"Prob ably False\"  if you think it is false but are not absolutely certain.  Some indiv iduals have difficulty categorizing their responses for a variety of reasons, such as it depends on the situation. In such cases, the participant should be encouraged to respond with regar d to their usual behavior, and which response is the most a ccurate for  them, ac ross all types of situations. ISLA QxQ 0 2-22-2001   2  Respons es are made based on a 4-point, ex tended True  False format, as follows: Definitely True (1), Probably True (2), Probab ly False (3), and Definitely False (4). The specific nature of what  criteria constitute a particular rating is d etermined subjectively by the participant. Any diffi culties in choos ing a response should be made with respect to the participants best guess. The participant should be reminded that there are no correct or inco rrect responses, and that we are si mply interested in their views. No items should be left blank.   ISLA QxQ 0 2-22-2001   3"

            "Q": "Medicatio n Survey  Form Instru ctions MSR, Version A, 09/28/2000 QxQ Date 02/22/2001   I. GENERAL INSTRUCTIONS  The Medic ation Survey (MSR) form is completed during the participant baseline clinic exam visit.  The purpose of the MS R is to assess medication usage in the two weeks preceding the examinat ion date.  Information on both prescription and non-prescription drugs and herbals is  ascertained.  To obtain this information, the participant is asked prior to the clinic visit to bring to the Exam Center all medications taken in the two-week period preceding the baseline visit.  Interviewers require certification in interviewing techniq ues and familiarity wit h the data entry procedures  for paper and electronic versions of  the form (references:  Data Entry System manual and the \"General  Instructions for Compl eting Paper  Forms\").  Transcribers and coders of m edication information also require certification.  Header information (I D Number, Contact Year, and Name) are completed in the format described in that document.   II. SPE CIFIC INSTRUCT IONS  A.  Reception  1. Did you bring all the medications you used in the past two weeks, or their containers ?            Y es, all  Y  Go to Section B and begin tra nscription while participant proce eds w ith clinic visit.   Go to Item #; tra nscribe those medications w hich were brought at  this time.  Some of th em S            N o  N   If the response is \"Yes , all\", go to Se ction B (MEDICATI ON TRANSCRIPTION) and begin the transcription.   This can take plac e at the reception station or while the participant proceeds with the clinic visit.  As the participant de livers  the medications, indicate wh ere (and by whom) they will be re turned before s/he leaves.  Mention that medication names will be copied from the labels, and that if required, medications will be taken out of their c ontainer only in the presence of, and with approval of , the participant.  Finally, in dicate that a trai ned in terviewer will later ask a few questions about each medication.  Verify that the medications bag is clearly identified wit h the MSRA QxQ 02-22-2001   Page 1 of 18 participant' s name.  Do not open the medications bag or  transcribe medications until the participant has signed the informed consent. If the response is \"Some of them,\" go to Item 3 to make arrangements with the participant to obtain the information for t hose medications which were not brought; transcribe those medic ations whic h were brought in Sec tion B (MEDICATION TRANSCRIPTION).  The prefe rred arrangement is for the participant to have all medication containers available at  the 24- hour sample pick up.  If that is not possible, arrangements should be made to follow up wit h the participant by telephone.  If the response is \"No\" , ask Item 2:  2. Is this because you forgot, because you have not taken any medications at  all in the last two weeks, or because  you could not bring your medications?       Took no medications   T Go to item 31 a      Forgot or was unable    to bring medications   F  If the response is \"Took no medication\" in the past two weeks, Sec tion A ends  here.  Leave Sect ion B (MEDICATION RECORDS) blank and skip  to ME DICATION TAKING BEHAVIORS, Section D.  If the response is \"Forgot or was unable to bring medic ations,\" reassure the respondent  with the statement Thats alright .  Since the information on medications is so important, we would still like to ask you about it during the interview.  Ask Item 3a:  3a. Could we follow up on this after the visit so that we can get the information  from the (other) medication labe ls?  [Expla in follow-up o ptions].      Y es   Y       No or not     applicable  N  [Attempt to convert refusals; indica te on Patient Itinerar y Form (PIN)].  Describe method of follow-up to be used:___________________ __________________ _________ _________________  MSRA QxQ 02-22-2001   Page 2 of 18 If the participant agrees to  follow- up, make arrangem ents for obtaining the information during the 24-hour sample pick-up or over the telephone.  Describe the method of follow-up after Ite m 3 on the form.  If  the participant brought some medications, complete as  much of Section B (MEDICATION TRANSCRIPTION) as possib le.  In case of deliberate omission to bri ng medications to the Exam Center, the interviewer attempts participant conver sion at the recepti on or a subsequent workstation.  If participant  conversion is to be attemp ted after reception, write a note to that effect on the Itinerar y Sheet.  Leave Section B (MEDICATION TRANSCRIPTION) items 4A  26B blank if no medications were brought in.  Even if the participant declines to bri ng in (or provide medication names during the 24-hour sample pick-up or by telephone inter view), attempt to complete as much of Section C, D, and E as possible.  If the participant has not brought her/his medications, but re members the names and concentration (strength) of all medications taken during the previous two weeks with confidence,  the interviewer can make t he judgment to record this information without a follow-up during the 24-hour sample pick up or via phone c all.  B.  Medica tions Transcription  Section B (MEDICATI ON TRANSCRIPTION) is  divide d into three components to document information about each medicati on used by the participant: (1) Transcription, (2) Intervie w, and (3) Medication Coding.   Transcription inc ludes recording in column (a) the medi cation name,  in column (b) concentration (strength), and in column (c) the i nstructions for admin istration of each medication used within the two weeks prior to the interview.  T he interview portion consists of determining and recording in colum n (d) whether the medi cation was taken within the last 24 hours.  Medication Codes are coded usi ng the DES ver sion of the MEDISPAN Medication Dictionary and recorded in colu mn (e).  The transcription of the medication name (column a), concentrati on (column b), and instructions for administration (column c) is  done by a trained transcriptionist prior to the interview with the participant or by an interviewer in  conjunction with the adm inistration of the questions in column (d).  The coding of the medications from  the DES medic ation dictionary can be done during the interview if the interviewer is certified in medication coding, or done later by a trained coder after the interview is completed.  Begin this process by opening the medicati ons bag and removing all medications.  In column (a), transcribe the medication name (in BLOCK LETTERS if using a paper form), followed by the concentration in colum n (b), and instructions for administration in column (c), beginning with Item 4.  Incl ude all parts of the medication nam e and any numbers and/or letters t hat identify the strength (concentration).  For keying purposes, the following format should be used when transcribing the medication name and concentration.  For example:  MSRA QxQ 02-22-2001   Page 3 of 18 Column (a)      Column (b)AMPICILLIN     250 mg AMPICILLIN LIQUID   125mg/5ml NOSTRIL      1/2 % ANACIN MAXIMUM STRENGTH  =====  Also copy any numbers and codes which follow or are part of  the name.

Do not use ditto marks (\") to indicate a repeat of a previous item.  Sometimes the drug name includes numbers or letters which could be mistaken for dosage.  Having these numbers or letters as part of the drug name helps in selecting the appropriate code.  T herefore, it is better to record  all the information related to medication name and concentration on the fo rm in a standard format.  The following guidelines are offer ed for standardization.  Medication Transcription   * Print complete names using block  capital letters.    * Record all identifying c haracters and numbers referring to concentration.  * Record instructions for administrati on completely as written on the labels using standardized abbr eviations if desired.    * Include as much identifying information as possible.  Sometimes the dosage form may appear to be part of the drug name since a few companies have trademarks for their dosag e forms.  For exam ple, Enseals for enteric coated tablets and Kapsea ls or Pulv ales for capsules.  You may record these names as identifying information. MSRA QxQ 02-22-2001   Page 6 of 18 Combination Drugs   Combination medicines contain two or more drugs in a single pill  or tablet.  Some combination medicines such as Dyazid e come in only one fixed combination (hydrochlorothiazide 25 mg and triamter ene 50 mg); these combination medicines do not generally list the strengt h.  Record DYAZIDE, in  the space medication name and do not record anything for concentration.  Other combination medicines such as Inderide are availa ble in more than one fixed dose combination (propranolol 40 mg and hy drochlorothiazide 25 mg; or propranolol 80 mg and hydrochlor othiazide 25 mg); thes e combination medicines generally list the strength as in \"Inderide 40/25\" or \"Inderi de 80/25.\"  For these medicines, record, for example, INDERIDE, in the space fo r name, and \"40/25\" or \"80/25\" after the name as the concentrati on.  For example:  Drugs containing two or  more me dications:   Example of fixed dosage:   Dyazide (hydrochlorothiazide and triamterene) code \"DYAZIDE\"   Examples of variable dosage: Inderide 40/25 (40 mg Inderal, 25 mg hydrochlorothiaz ide) code \"INDERIDE 40/25\"  Inderide 80/25 (80 mg Inderal, 25 mg hydrochlorothiaz ide) code \"INDERIDE 80/25\"  * Do not record flavors of products and whether the preparat ions are sugar-free or sodium-free.  Concentration   Most drug concentrations are given in grams,  milligrams or microg rams.  Record as written  on the label us ing the abb reviations  \"gm\" for grams, \"mg\" for milligrams and \"mcg\" for micrograms.  Rarely the dos age may be given in grains.  Use the abbreviation \"gr\" for this.  When strength is not recorded as  milligra ms (mg) record all numb ers, digits and characters used to denote concentration; thi s includes:   .  -  decimal point    gm  =  gram(s) ml  -  milliliter    gr    =  grain(s) /ml  -  per milliliter    mg  =  milligram mEq  -  millie quivalents    mcg =  microgram hr  -  hour /hr  -  per hour MSRA QxQ 02-22-2001   Page 7 of 18 %  - percent   Note: When the abbreviati on, \"PC\" (percent) is used, record percent symbol, \"%.\"  SPECIFICS:  * Record strength of combination drugs  where strength i s separated by a \"/\" here.  * Liquid medicine conce ntration is o ften written in mg/ml (milligrams per milliliter).  For example , Ampic illin 125 mg /5 ml, is recorded as: \"AMPICILLIN for name and 125 mg/5ml\" for concentration.  * Concentration for some medicines ma y be w ritten as a percentage.  For example: Alupent 0.6%, is recorded as:  \"ALUPENT  for name and 0.6%\" for concentration  * Concentration for insulin is genera lly \"U10 0\" or 100 units per millilit er.\"  This is often written as \"100/ml\" or \"100U/ml. \"  Record Insulin concentration as \"U100\" unless another strength is listed on the label.  NOTE:  Do not record the quantity or  number of pills/tablets dispen sed.  If more than 26 medications are present or reported by the participant, only 26 medications are coded and keyed, selected according to the priorities described below. If it i s necessary to defer the assi gnation of priorities for medications to be transcribed, the name and str ength of each additional medication is  recorded on the back of page 3 of the paper form, until 26 medication names are selected for transcription and coding.  Medications ma y be prioritiz ed during transcription by combining the transcription and interview components.  Prioritization is performed only if there are more than 26 medications and is based on the following algorit hm: prescri ption m edications first; then aspirin, aspirin-containing medications and anti-inflammatory  preparations (aspirin, Alka-Selt zer, headache powders, cold medicine, medication for arthritis); follo wed by other over-the-counter preparations; then vitami ns and food supplements and any other medications last.

For example, if there were 7 medications in the bag, and you were able to  transcribe 5 of t hem, items 27 and 28 would be completed as follows:    7 027.  Total number of medications in bag:   5 028.  Number of medicati ons unable to transcribe:  Open containers to examine medications only in the presence of the participant.

If the interview por tion has not been administered, place the MSR paper form (if appropriate) in the medica tion bag and take the medication bag to a secure location for use at t he workstation in which the in terview will be admin istered.  If the interview portion of t he form has been administered, take the bag to a secure place for returning to the parti cipant at the medical dat a review workstation.  AT NO TIME SHOULD THE MEDICATI ONS BE LEFT UNAT TENDED A ND UNSE CURED.  Column (e). CODE NUMBER.  The 14-digit medication code numbers ar e found in the DES version of the Medication Dictionary which has been distri buted to the Exam Center.  The drug names are listed in alphabet ical order.  Drug names t hat begin with a number, ditto (\"), or a dash (-) are listed first.  If a drug name is separated by a hyphen, the portion of the name preceding the hyphen is  listed in alphabetical order.  If you encounter a drug name which is not in the dictionary, do not guess at a match.  Simply set the status code to Q (questi onable) so that the pharmacist at the Coordinating Center can develop a code number and update the dictionary.  Numbers that appear in the di ctionary are used to differ entiate between products.  Before coding a drug entry, determine whet her the numbers which are recorded are part of the name or are str ength/concentration information.  Numbers referring to strength/concentration are not  used in the matching proce ss for medication coding.  Some drug products use a suffix to di stinguis h between combination products containing the same primar y drug.  For example:    Darvon = propoxyphene hydrochloride   Darvon N = propoxyphene napsylate   Darvon Cmpd = propoxyphene hy drochloride with aspirin and caffeine   Darvon wit h ASA = propo xyphe ne hydrochloride and a spirin  When coding a medication whic h contains more than one word, look for a match of the entire name in the dict ionary.  If the name matc hes, enter the corresponding code.  If a complete match cannot be found, but the dictionary has a single entry for the ingredient(s) in the medication (usua lly the first word of the drug name), and there are no other entries containing this word , select the corresponding code.  This occurs most often when:  both the brand and generic name are transcribed, but only one is given in the dictionary;  the form of the drug is  transcribed, but not gi ven in the dictionary;  the seller's name is transcribed, but  is not listed in the dictionary. MSRA QxQ 02-22-2001   Page 10 of 18  It is critical that the other words in  the transcribed drug name do NOT involve additional ingredients.    Examples:  CORDARONE/AMIODARONE not in the dictionary; code as AMIODARONE, whic h is listed.  DIMETAPP ELIXIR not in the dictionary; code as DIMETAPP , which is listed.    ECKERD ALLERGY  not in the dictionary; code   RELIEF TABS   as ALLERGY RELIEF,        w hich is listed.  TYLENOL NO. 3 not in the dictionary; cannot code, since \"NO.3\" could designate another ingredient; in fact, it designates codeine. It can be coded by searching for the abbreviation of Tylenol's ingredient wit h codeine: APAP W CODEINE, which is in the dictionary.  In order to put drug nam es on the prescription label, pharmacists may use abbreviations.  Unfortunately, these abbrev iations are often not standardized.  Some frequently used abbreviations, however, occur in the Medication Dictionary.  For example:   APAP =  acetami nophen   HC =  hydrocortisone  ASA =  aspirin    HCI =  hydrochloride  CAFF  =  caffeine    HCTZ  =  hydrochlorothiazide  Cl =  chloride    IV =  intravenous  CMP  =  compound    K =  potassium  COD =  codeine    M =  minerals  DM =  dextromethorphan  SR =  sustained release  Fl =  fluoride    T =  therapeutic  GG =  glyceralguiacolate  XR =  extended release  Column (d).  USE IN PAST 24 HO URS  After the transcription of the medi cation name, concentration, and instructions for administration, or the verification of t he accuracy of the transcription and its use within the last 2 weeks, the interviewer as certains the use of each medicatio n within the past 24 hours, while showing the participant each separate container .  The MSRA QxQ 02-22-2001   Page 11 of 18 following question is asked for each medication:   d. \"Did you take this medi cation in the last 24 hours?\"  If probing is required to assist the par ticipant in remembering, the question  may be  repeated , specifying a time on the previous day.  For example, \"Have you taken this medication since 10:00  a.m. yesterday?\"   A MEDICATION NAME     B CONCENTRATION     C INSTRUCTIONS FOR ADMI NISTRAT ION      D DID YOU TAKE  THIS MEDI CATIO N IN PAST 24 HOURS?   YES  Y, NO - N DONT KNOW  D   E CODE NUMBER    4. NORVASC  5mg   1 dail y            Y          N          D               5. KCL  20mEq   1 dail y            Y          N          D                 Repeat this  process for all medications, e.g., transcribe or verify the transcription of the medication/concentrati on and ask the question in colu mn (d).  Determine from Item 28 on the form at the end of Section B whether  there are any medications in the bag for which the receptionist was unable to transcribe the name/concentration.  These may include unmarked containers, loos e pills, and containers with more than one medic ation.  Ask the participant to  open any unmarked containers, and to handle loos e pills.  With the participant's help  and using a Physicia ns Desk Reference (PDR), attempt to identify these m edications.  If possible,  enter the name and concentration, and ask if t he medication was taken in t he last 24 hours.  If the medication cannot be identified,  write UNKNOWN for the m edication name and draw two horizontal lines through the boxes (enter  \"=\" in the spaces) for the medication code number.  If additional medic ations can be transcribed, adjust the total for Item 28. \"Number of medications una ble to transcribe:\", accord ingly.  After this has been completed for all containers, prescripti ons and medications in the bag, probe the participant on whether  all medications taken in the previous two weeks are included.  For any additional medications recalled by  the participant, record the names and answer the questions with as much detail as  possible.  If there is any doubt, arrange for a review during the 24-hour pick up or phone call during whic h the participant can provide acc urate information.  During the rest of the Medication Survey interview or during a subsequent interview, the participant may recall other medication s or vitamins taken during the past two MSRA QxQ 02-22-2001   Page 12 of 18 weeks.  Their name, concentrations, and instructions for administration, are transcribed in columns (a), (b), and (c),  respectively, and last ingestion (use) is recorded in column (d) at this time, just as  if they had been in the medication bag.  Howev er, the number of medications in the bag is not changed . This documents that information on some medications were pr ovided from the participant's memory.  C.  In terview  This portion of the Medication Survey is  administered by  the nurse-clinician or a trained interviewer.  For Item  30, ask if medications were tak en in the past tw o weeks for the nine lis ted reasons.  The following synony ms may be given in response to participant questions.  a. High blood pressure = hypertension c. Angina or chest pain = heart pains d. Control of heart rhythm = medicine for fast or irregular heart rate or heart beats e. Heart failure = congestive heart failure, not heart attack f. Blood thinning = anticoagulation i. Leg pain when walk ing = claudic ation  NOTE:  Stroke does not include TIA nor \"sli ght strokes\" which last ed less than 24 hours.  For example, if the parti cipant had taken medication for high blood pressure and claudication and no other listed conditions,  Item 30 would be coded as follows:   30. Were any of the medications you took during the past two weeks for:       [If \"Yes ,\" verify  that m edication name is on medication record.]               Dont           Yes No Know a.  High Blood Pressure     Y N D   b.  High Blood Choles terol     Y N D   c.  Angina or Chest Pain     Y N D   d.  Control of Heart Rhythm    Y N D  MSRA QxQ 02-22-2001   Page 13 of 18  e.  Heart Failure       Y N D   f.  Blood Thinning      Y N D   g.  Diabetes or High Blood Sugar    Y N D   h .  Stroke       Y  N D   i.  Leg pain when walk ing     Y N D   If any of the conditions are answered affirmat ively, be sure that the medication is recorded in Section B.  The interviewer, however, can not  ask the participant to identify which medication was used to treat any of the conditions.   For example, if the participant reported taking a medication to lower blood pressure during the last two weeks (Item 30.a), and no recognizabl e antihypertensive medic ations were recorded in Section B, the interviewer ma y probe to determine if the names of all medications taken during the last two weeks were recorded.  If the person indicates that the names of all her/his medications  have been transcribed, the interviewer can not probe further to determine which medica tion was used to treat the high blood pressure.  D. Medication Taking Behaviors  This section is obtains  information on t he participants usual medic ation-taking behaviors, or taking medica tions as prescribed.  Item 31 is asked of all participants regardle ss of whether they reported taking any medication during the past two weeks or w hether they brought day medication to the Exam Center.  This question is asked as worded.  Expla nation about memory jogging or thinking of times when they hav e taken prescription medications in the past may be offered at the beginning of this  question.  Read each item in the list and indicate whether the item was indicated or not as a reason for taki ng medications exactly as prescribed.  For example, if the parti cipant had indicated they had not taken medications according to directions  by reason of not lik ing to take me dicine s and that it made them feel bad, Item 31 would be c oded as follows: MSRA QxQ 02-22-2001   Page 14 of 18           R eason  N ot a  D ont        Indicate d Reason  Know a.  You were i n a hurry, too busy, or forg ot        Y  N  D  b.  It was in convenient, for example, the medication       needed to be refri gerate d, or had to b e taken with food.   Y  N  D  c.

You did not have money to purcha se the medi catio n       (or its refill s)         Y  N  D  j.  Did not have the medication available  .      Y  N  D  k.  Are there any other rea sons why you havent take n a       prescri bed medicatio n?  Y   N  D  l.  If yes, specify reason:     E.  Aspirin and NSAID Use  32. Although the prim ary purpose of Item 32 is to  identify participants who are taking aspir in, the question is broadly constructed to include aspirin and other medications which may contain aspirin but are not necessarily labeled as aspirin, such as \"Alka-Seltzer, cold medicine or headache powder.\"  Therefore, this question may identify persons taking medications which do not include aspirin.  33. Read the transition statement and Ite m 33 to all participants who responded Yes to Item 32.  We are after the current use (NOW ) of aspirin or aspirin containing medication on a REGULAR basis , regardless of the reason for its use.  These medications do not include Tyle nol, Advil, etc.  Consult the list of Aspirin or Aspirin Containing Medications at the end of these instructions if in MSRA QxQ 02-22-2001   Page 15 of 18 doubt.  If asked by the participant, \"regular\" is defined as at least once a week  for several months.  If the response is  \"No\" or \"Unknown,\" skip to Item 35.  When the response is Yes, continue by asking Item 34a.  34a. Read the question and select the appropr iate letter from the four response codes.  Strength refers to the number of milligrams of aspirin per pill, not the total number of milligr ams taken.  (Buffe red aspirin doe s not refer to strength, but to added ingredie nts.)  The participant  may offer the actual milligrams, which can be categorized as shown in t he responses.  If the person can recall that the strength of the pill was not  baby, but can not di stinguish b etween regular and extra strength, code as regul ar, 'B.'  If the participant does not remember at all, record \"Don't Know.\"  34b. Read the question.  The purpose of  this question is to document the number of days per week aspirin is taken .  Record the typical frequency (i.e., \"on average\") of the aspirin that is used on a regular basis.  If less than one day per week, record as zero.  Round half days up to the next integer.  The maximum number of days per week is 7.  34c. Read the question.  In c ontrast to part (b),  the purpose of this question is to document the average number  of aspirin tablets t he person takes during a typical wee k.  'Pills' refers to both aspi rin and  aspirin con taining me dications, either in tablet or powder form.  If >99, reco rd as 99.  If < 1, record as zero.  If \"half tablets\" were used, divide the number of half tablets by 2 and round fractions up to the next integer.  For exam ple, record the use of 7 half tablets of aspirin per week as 04.  34d. Read the question.  Do not read the c hoices.   If the parti cipant mentions avoiding heart attack or stroke as part of her/his respons e, record \"H.\"  Individuals could be followi ng the advice of their provider of medical care in doing this, or they could be acting on their own, based on information obtained through the media, friends or other sources.  If the participant mentions \"blood thinning\" or avoiding blood clots as the reason for taking aspirin, record \"H.\"  If neither a heart attack or stro ke is mentioned, record \"O,\" even if the aspirin was prescri bed by a physician.  With a positive response to the initial Item 32, confirm whether the reported medication(s) is transcribed in section B.  34e. Enter the year and month of  the onset of regular use in  34e.  If the participant is unsure, ask for a best guess.  If an es timate cannot be made, record \"==\" in the appropriate month and year field(s).  If the partici pant can only estimate the year, use 06 for the month.  35. Read Item 35 as written.   Item 35a parallels the as pirin question (Item 33) but documents the current, regular use of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAID).  Item 35 excludes Tylenol and aspirin (as separate entities) and MSRA QxQ 02-22-2001   Page 16 of 18 steroids.  N onsteroidal drugs are t he most common non-aspirin treatments of arthritis.  If the partici pant is unsure about a medici ne but mentions its name, quickly check the LIST  OF NON- STEROIDAL ANTI-INFLAMMATORY DRUGS to decide.  No te skip patterns.   If participant ans wers YES, then continue by  reading 35b.  b. If the response to 35b is Ibuprofen or Advil, record \"I\" and skip to 35d.  If the participant reports a different  non-steroi dal anti-inflammatory drug, then code \"O\" for Other and transcribe the name in Item 35c.  c. Do not ask this question; record the name based on the response to Item 35b.  If the preparation is availabl e, use it to verify the respons e.  d. Read the question.  The purpose of this question is to document the average number of NS AID tablets the person takes during a typical week.  'Pills' refers to t ablets.  If >99, record as 99.  If < 1, record as zero.  If \"half tablets\" were used, di vide the number of half tablets by 2 and round fractions up to the next  integer.  For example, record the use of 7 half tablets of Ibuprofen per week as 04.  e. Read Item 34e inserting the brand name of the drug where indicat ed and record the month and year t he participant began taking the drug on a regular basis.  F.  Folk Medicine  This section documents the us e of home remedies or folk  medicines during the last two weeks.  36-42. Read Items 36-42 exactly as worded.  For each affirmati ve choice determine and record the number of days the re medy was used during the past two weeks and the purpose for its use.  Reco rd the purpose verbat im in the space provided.  If additional space is needed, add a note log in the DES.  43. Read Item 43 to all respondents, emphasiz ing ever.  If  Yes, continue on with Items 43b and 43c.  If No, end the interview.  G.  ADMINISTRATIVE INFORMATION  44. Enter the date of data collection.  45. Enter the method of data collect ion by paper (P) or computer (C).  46. Enter the 3-digit JHS interviewer ID  of the person completing this form. MSRA QxQ 02-22-2001   Page 17 of 18"

            "Q": "PHYSICIAL ACTIVITY FORM INSTRUCTIONS (PAC) VERSION A, 02/22/2001   I. SPECIFIC INSTRUCTIONS   The Physical Activity Form (PAC) is in cluded in the Home Induction Interview and collects data regarding activities of active living, occupational, home and sports/exercise over the past 12 months .  Interviewers mu st be certified and familiar with and understand the General Instructions for Completing Paper Forms,\" prior to completing this fo rm.  ID, Contact, Year and Name are completed as described in that document.  Initiate the form by reading the script at the beginning of the form as printed.   II SPECIFIC INSTRUCTIONS  A. Active Living These items assess the participants general level of activity in getting to and from work, or during leisure time.  Certify with the participant that these activities do not include work-related duties. Some of these items refer to work/volunteer work and some refer to le isure time.  If participant becomes confused about this, repeat the question.   Remind the participant that all activi ties refer to the past 12 months. For each of these items, record one answer per question.  Show the participant Response Card 1. Read the response categories out loud the first time it is shown; it is not necessary to reread a card that has been shown before unless the participant asks fo r (or needs) assistance.  This item refers only to walking or biking associat ed with going to and from work or school, or doing errands not associated with routine work activities.  It does not refer to walking or biking for recreation/leisure , nor does it refer to walking or biking done as part of the work day which will be requested in a later item. Show the participant Response Card 2. Like Item 1, this item also does not refer to walking for recreation . Show the participant Response Card 3. This item is specific for leisure time or recreational  walking.  It should not include walking at work or doing shopping. Continue with Response Card 3. This item is specific for leisure time or recreational  biking.  Continue with Response Card 3. This item is specific to leisure or recreational activity .  If the participant says s/he sweats due to heat and humidity, try to get her/him to focus on whether s/he sweats due to the effort of the activity . Show the participant Response Card 4. The response should be an average amount during the past year. This item does not have a Response Card.  We want the participants estimate of a the number of times in a u sual week that s/he did exercise for at least 20 minutes without stopping whic h was hard enough to make heart rate and breathing increase a large amount.  For ma ny participants, this will be 0.   B. Occupational Activities  Record one answer per question. If the participant did not work for pay or do volunteer work during the past year, omit questions 9 through 11e.  T he interviewer should be aware that particularly for some older, retired, individuals, vol unteer activity may be an important stimulus for physi cal activity.  In additi on, both male and female participants may be involved in active volunteer tasks for their church or community.]  Show Response Card 5 and record response.  This item discusses the participants perception of the precise demands of their work compared with others their age.  Assure the respondent  there are no right or wrong answers as needed.   Show Response Card 6 and record response.  This item discusses how fatigued is the respondent at t he end of the normal workday.   :  Show Response Card 6. These items assess the frequency of sitting, standing, walking, lifting or  sweating from exertion during the workday .  For 11e, note that this question asks about sweating as a result of activity , not background temperature.  If the partici pants say they sweat a lot because it is hot outside, try to get them to focus on sweat due to activity and not ambient conditions.  C. Home, Family, Yard and Garden  This section inquires about how often ce rtain activities are performed around the home. All activities refer to an average over the past 12 months. Some of these could  be done for pay or as volunteer work, but in this section we only want activity that is not for pay and is not done as volunteer work .  These activities are familiar to everyone and asking about them can help participants feel you understand and appreciate the kind of activi ties they do every day.  Record only one answer for each item.  Show Response Card 7.  This item asse sses time spent in child or older care activities.  Show Response Card 8.  This item a ssesses time spent in meal preparation and cleaning.  Show Response Card 3.  This item assesses time spent in having house or vehicle cleaning activities. Show Response Card 3.  This item assesses time spent in routine house cleaning or shopping activities.  Show Response Card 3.  This item asse sses time spent in gardening or yard work. Show Response Card 3.  This item a ssesses time spent in home decorating or repair.  Show Response Card 3.  D. Sports and Exercise  The last section inquires about partici pation in specific sport and exercise activities, again for only the past 12 months .  Many respondents will indicate they did not participate in any of the activities.  If the response is \"N O,\" go to item 30 to complete the survey.  Record only one answer per item.    (19) Hand the participant the SPORTS AND EXERCISE LIST. Record whether the respondent participated in days the activities listed. If the response to item 20 is \"NO,\" go to it em 3 to complete the surv ey.  Show Response Card 9 and record frequency of exercise. (21) This item is indented to gather information on up to three activities, in order of frequency, and to indicate how many months and how many hours of participation for each. (21a.)   Indicate if the most frequent sport or exerci se activity is on the list.  (21b.)   Write the 3-digit code for the activity in the boxes using the Sports and Exercise test and leading zeroes as needed. (21c.)   If the most frequent sport or  exercise activity reported by the participant does not seem to match any  of those listed, then print the name of the activity or description clearly in the boxes provided. Show Response Card 11 to get the frequency of the activity. (22) Show Response Card 10 to get the amount of time spent in this activity.  The answer to this item c ould be confusing to a person who just started doing an activity recently.  In th is case, the interviewer should try to estimate how much of the year the person would have done this activity if they had been doing it all year. For exampl e, if s/he started lifting weights 4 months ago and did it for 3 of  the 4 months, estimate  of a year or 9 months. (23) Show Response Card 11 to get the hours per week that this activity is performed.  The time should not incl ude rest time.  If the reported hours seem excessive, repeat it to  the participant to be certai n.  If the activity is performed for more hours a week during some seasons of the year, record an average over the months that  the activity is performed.   If a participant swims 1 hour a week during June, July, and Augus t but not at all during the rest of the year, record one hour as the response for this item. 24a.  Give the participant the SPORT AND EXERCISE LIST. Determine if there is a   second activity, if not, go to  item 30 to complete the survey. (24b.) Write the 3-digit code for the second most frequent sport or exercise activity in the boxes. (24c.) See instructions for 21.C. above. (25) See instructions for 22 above. (26) See instructions for 23 above. (27)  See instructions fo r Item 21 above.  If there is  no third most frequent sport activity, go to Item 30 to  complete the survey. (28) See instructions for Item 22 above. (29) See instructions for Item 23 above.  (30) Show Response Card 12.  This it em assesses the participants perception of her or his recreational activity in comparison with others of the same age.  Reassure the participant there are no right or wrong answers as needed.  E. Administrative Information  (31) Enter the date that the in terview information was obtained. (32) Enter the code of the per son computing this form.   F. Coding and Scoring  The ACTIVE LIVING INDEX is calculat ed as the sum of [Q1 ,Q3, Q4, (6-Q6) divided by 4.  The OCCUPATIONAL INDEX is calculated as the sum of [Q 9, Q10, (6-Q11a), Q11b-e, occupational intensity code]/8.  The occupational intensity code comes from the physical demands of the occupat ion of 1=low, 3=medium, and 5=high from the Department of Labor Occupational Codes.  The HOME, FAMLY, YARD, AND GARDEN i ndex will be calculated as the sum of [Q12, Q13, Q14, Q 15, Q16, Q17, Q18]/7.  The SPORT INDEX calculation requires several steps. We will use the method described by Ainsworth, Sternfield, et al.  1. First, each of the activities reporte d by the participant must be scored by intensity as < 4 METs/4-6 METs/>6 METs.  This is done by computer matching the code number for the activity with intensity values for each code.   2. Then the months per year must be converted to a proportion of the year (0.5-1.3-2.5-3.5-4.5).  This  is also done by computer. Months per Year Proportion <1 0.5 1-3 1.3 4-6 2.5 7-9 3.5 >9 4.5  3. The time for each activity is  then converted to a proportion:  Time, Hours per Week Proportion <1 0.04 At least 1 but < 2 0.17 At least 2 but < 3 0.42 At least 3 but < 4 0.67 4 or more 0.92  4. The simple sport score is calculated multiplying intensity by proportion by time for each specified activity and summing over number of activities (Q22, Q25, Q28). 5. If no activities were specified, the sum will be 0. 6. The simple sport score will take t he value of 1-2-3-4-5 corresponding to the scores of 0/0.01- <4/4-<8/8-<12/>12. 7. The index can now be  calculated as the sum of [Q30, simple sport score]/4."

GENERAL INSTRUCTIONS  The Personal and Family Health History (P FH) is the fi rst section of the Home Induction Interview and collects informati on on the participants health status, personal health history and family health hi story. The exact wording and order of the questions s hould be followed to ensure st andardization. Questions should not be skipped unless indicat ed by the skip pattern instructions.  Because there are several skip patterns in this section, the intervie wer should be v ery familiar with the flow of the questions to insure smooth administra tion with a conversational tone. The interviewer must be certified and have worki ng knowledge of the document General Instructions for Compl eting Paper  Forms prio r to compl eting this form.  ID Number, Contact Year and Name should be completed as  described in that form.  Initiate the form by reading the script at the begi nning of  the form as printed.   II. SPE CIFIC INSTRUCT IONS  Health  Status   1. This standardized question is int ended to assess the participants assessment of their overall health s tatus in compar ison with other persons in their same age range. Circle the response pr ovided by the respondent.  Personal  Health Problems   2-11. This is a series of questions r egarding particular health conditions diagnosed by a health care provider. Enter YES, NO or UNSURE/UNKNOWN for each item that identifies a spec ific condition (Items 2-11a). A  response is positive (YES) only if the condition was diagnosed by a health care provider. A diagn osis o f borderline is coded as YES if the particip ants condit ion was diagnosed by a health care provider as borderline. For example, a participant may tell you that My doctor told me I have borderline diabetes or My doctor said I had a touch of sugar. NOTE: Fo r item 7a, \"kidney problem\" does not refer to bladder infections.  NO is recorded is (1) the respondent was told by a health care provider that s/he did not have the condition specified, (2) was never told by a health care  provider that s/he had the condition, or (3) w as never tested for the condition.  UNSURE/ UNKOWN is recorded if the respo ndent is not sure that the health care provider said s/he had this condition. The code of UNSURE/ UNKNOWN PFHA QxQ 02- 21-2001   1 is most frequently used when the re spondent cannot remember accurately what the health care provider said. Do not define the condition yourself based on the respondents answer. Record ambi guous responses in a note log.   For each YES respon se to Items 2-11a, in  items 2-11b enter the age at which  the respondent was first told of this condi tion by a health care provider. If the respondent  does not remember the exact age or year which a health care provider first told her or him of the condition,  ask for and record a best estimate of the age.

General St atement to  Participants  The statement below s hould be read to a ll participants before providing them with the Approach to Life Bring to Clinic questionnaires.  We are asking that you complete this packet of questionnaires at home. You should bring these  forms with you to your Clin ic Exam visit. In this packet, there are questions c overing different topics. You will read some that ask about how much support you feel from your family and fr iends . Other questions ask about how you deal with stress. We are interested in your honest answers to these questions  because we want to know more about how we cope or deal with stress relates to health in general, and particularly  heart disease.  This packet has several parts to it.  At  the beginn ing of  each part, there will b e instructions telling you how to answer t he questions. Please take your time to answer eac h question carefully. Please do not skip any questions. Remember that there are no right or w rong answers.  We  are interested in your feelings and opinions.   If you do not understand the instructions for one of the questi onnaires or do not understand one of the questions, please tell the Jackson Heart Study staff me mber when you a rrive for your Clinic Exam visit. They will be happy to help you.  Thank you for filling o ut these questionna ires.  II. Checking the Questionnaires  When reviewing/p icking up the B ring to Clin ic questionnaires, check to make sure that all items on each questionnaire were ans wered. If there are blank items, offer the participant the opportunity to complete  the item(s), and provide any assistance needed. Mr. or Mrs. (Participant), Ive notic ed that some of the qu estions were left blank. Would you mind answering these for me  now?  If the parti cipant left the items blank intent ionally, the interviewer should explain the rationale to the participant again, and reassure the partici pant about confidentiality . If the parti cipant does  feel comfortable answering the questions for so me reason, this should be noted, and the participant should be thanked for pointing out their concerns.  RCPA QxQ 02-2 2-2001   1 III. Answering  Participants Quest ions  Participant s may have questions about particular items. The interviewer should read the item again, and provide a neutral prompt, such as, Ans wer whats right for you or Answer what makes t he most sense to you.  Most of the terms used in the various ra ting scales (e.g., Almost N ever, Almost Always, Most of the Time, Rarely, etc.) are left to the parti cipants s ubjective perception of what these m ean. If the participant has a qu estion a bout the scaling on a particular questionnaire, the interviewe r should provide only neutral information, such as, U se it the way that you would no rmally use it in conversation, or, Pick the answer that is closest to what is ri ght fo r you. Remind the partici pant that there are no right or wrong ans wers to the questions, and t hat we are simply interested in their views.  If the participant has questions about a par ticular item or requires assistance completing the questionnaire (illiteracy or visu al deficit), keep in mind that many of these questions are quite personal, and may be perceived as sensitive or potentially embarrassing to the participant. Read all questions in a neutral, non judgmental tone. Be sure to conduct this in a manner that assures their privacy .  When the response categories ar e repetitive (such as True or False or Yes or No), and the participant appears to understand the questions and provides reasonable answers, the interviewer may choose not to read the response categories to every question.   IV. General Instructions  The Appro ach to Life C: Relig ion/Religious Coping/Helplessness( RCP) form is completed by the parti cipant as part of the A pproach to Life Form.   V.

We are intereste d in how often you participate in any type of or ganized religious worship at Church or in other places, participate in private meditation or prayer and have particular religious spiritual experiences.   Please ans wer all the questions as best you can.  The participant should be reminded that there are no correct or incorrect responses, and that we are simply interested in thei r views and experiences. No items should be left blank.

            "Q": "RHXAQxQ02232001   1 Reproductive History Form Instructions  RHX Version C, 12/01/95  QxQ Date 02/23/2001    I. GENERAL INSTRUCTIONS   The Reproductive History Form (RHX) is completed during the female participant's baseline clinic visit.  The interviewer must be certified and sh ould have a working knowledge of the data entry procedures for the electronic version from and the document titled \"General Instructions for Completing Paper Forms\" prior to completing this form.  ID Number, Contact Year, and Name should be completed as described in that document.   The purpose of the RHX is to obtain baseline information on the female participants' menstrual history and pregnancy, gynecologic surgery or radiation therapy, and use of supplemental female hormones for reasons other than birth control (estrogen hormone replacement therapy). The exact wording and order of the questions should be followed to ensure standardization.  Items should not be skipped unless indicated by the skip pattern instructions.  Because there are many skip patterns , the interviewer should be very familiar with the flow of the survey to insure smooth administration with a conversational tone.  Items in BRACKETS and/or CAPITAL LETTERS are instructions to the interviewer and are not read to the participant.   READ THE I TEMS CLEARLY USING THE EXACT WORDING ON THE FORM.  The introductory and transitional scripts may deviate from the prototypes provided, but must include the same information.   Some participants may view this material as very sensitive.  The interviewer should be aware of the sensitive nature of the information and make the participant feel comfortable.  If required, the interviewer should explain that these are characteristics that sometimes can explain the development of heart disease.  Beyond this, however , no specific information should be mentioned to the participant.    II. SPECIFIC INSTRUCTIONS   A. Menstrual History and Pregnancies   1. The exact age in years should be reported.  If the participant reports the time in school grades, probe for years.  A \"b est estimate\" is acceptable if the interviewer feels confident that a thoughtful estimate is provided.  If the participant is unsure of at what age her first menstrual period occurred, probe by asking about possible other associated life events which she RHXAQxQ02232001   2 may recall more clearly.  If she still does not know, draw 2 horizontal lines through the boxes.   If the participant says that she has never menstruated, enter \"0\" and skip to Item 12.   2. Include pregnancies resulting in miscarriage and abortion.  If the participant was uncertain of a pregnancy, do not include it in the total.  If not known, draw 2 horizontal lines through the boxes.   3. If not known, draw 2 horizontal lines through the boxes.   4. Even if the participant has had only one menstrual period in the past 2 years, or reports any bleeding in the past 2 years, enter \"Yes.\"  Consider regular bleeding induced by hormone medication as a menstrual period.   5. If the participant can not remember when she had her last menstrual period, draw 2 horizontal l ines through the boxes.   6. Read the Item and the response categories after handing the Response Card to the participant.  The overall intent of this question is to identify the reason for the above reported menstrual periods or bleeding during the last 2 years; a narrower objective is to identify the cause of periods/bleeding in women who are postmenopausal.    Response Categories for Item 6   Natural periods  Cyclic vaginal  bleeding women experience when pre-  or peri -menopausal.   Hormone Only  Use of hormone  replacement treatment during menopause or peri -menopause (i.e., not hormones for the purpose of contraception) which can result in cyclic and non- cyclic uterine bleeding.   Illness  Cancer, infections, miscarriage, etc. can cause non-cyclic uterine bleeding .  Other  Conditions other than natural periods, hormone use or illnesses can cause vaginal bleeding, and should be coded as other.   Don't Know  Unexplained vaginal bleeding due to an unknown cause is coded as \"Don't Know.\"   RHXAQxQ02232001   3  If more than one response category is applicable, ask the participant to select the one which explains the cause of the majority of her periods or bleeding during the last two years.   A response of ILLNESS, OTHER or DON'T KNOW will be discussed with the participant during the medical dat a review.   7. This item determines the number of periods missed over the last 2 years.  If the participant has not missed any periods over the last 2 years, enter '00' and skip to Item 11.  If not known, draw 2 horizontal lines through the boxes.   8. If the term \"menopause\" is not immediately understood, ask: \"Have your periods stopped for at least 6 months?\"  If the participant hesitates or is unsure, record \"unknown\" as her response and skip to Item 11.  If she reports with certainty that she has not reac hed menopause, enter \"NO\" and skip to Item 12.   9. If not known, draw two horizontal lines through the boxes.  A logical inconsistency among the previous responses is acceptable here; for instance, if a participant has indicated that she has reached menopa use (YES to Item 8) but she has also reported menstrual periods or bleeding within the last 6 months (Items 4, 5 or 7).  There could be reasons for these \"inconsistencies\" which are not explored in the interview, such as irregular menses or symptoms associ ated with the peri -menopausal stage.   10. If the participant reports that she had already reached menopause before she had gynecological surgery, record the response as \"natural.\"   11. If the participant is unsure of having hot flashes and asks for clarifi cation, define a hot flash as \"an intense sensation of warmth or feeling flushed all over, lasting anywhere from a few seconds to a few minutes.\"   B. Birth Control Pills   12. Only include birth control pills used for family planning purposes.  Birth control pills used exclusively for non- family planning purposes should be noted in Section C (Hormone Use).   If the participant only reports ever taking one complete birth control pill cycle (21 or 28 day) in her lifetime, record \"Yes.\"  If the participant never  completed even 1 (21 or 28 day) birth control pill cycle, record \"No.\"  (Consider a complete \"mini -pill\" regimen the same as a birth control pill cycle.)   RHXAQxQ02232001   4 13. If the participant has started taking birth control pills several times, record the age of the f irst time.  If not known, draw 2 horizontal lines through the boxes.   14. \"Current\" refers to the time of the interview.  If \"Yes,\" go to Item 16.   15. Record the age when birth control pills were stopped for the last time.  If not known, draw 2 horizontal  lines through the boxes.   Note:   A participant using 21- day cycle birth control pills might answer \"No\" to Item 14 if she is currently menstruating and not \"currently taking\" a daily pill for that week.  Probe for this situation if the participant hesitat es or acts surprised when you ask Item 15.   16. Enter the total number of years of usage.  If the participant has used the birth control pill more than once, enter the total number of years used, not counting the intervening periods of non- use.  This requi res all the time intervals of usage to be summed and then the total rounded off to the nearest year.  Round partial year amount of 1 to 6 full months up.  (Example:  If 2 years, 6 1/2 months is the total reported, record this as \"3 years.\")  If the total \" years\" of usage is less than 6 full months, enter \"00.\"  (Example:  If 5 1/2 months, record \"00;\"  if 6 1/2 months, record \"01\").  If not known, draw 2 horizontal lines through the boxes.   C. Hormone Use   17, 24, 30, & 36.  Hormonal creams do not apply.  Bi rth control pills prescribed for therapeutic indications other than family planning should  be included in this section (e.g., for control of symptoms of a painful pelvic condition called \"endometriosis,\" for control of too frequent or too irregular menstrual periods).  If the participant only reports having taken at least one complete cycle (21 or 28 day), record \"YES.\"  (Consider a complete \"mini- pill\" regimen the same as a cycle.)  If the participant has not completed even one (21 or 28 day) cycle, record \"NO.\"  If the response is NO or UNKNOWN, go to Item 42.   NOTE: Items 18 -41 record information on a maximum of four different hormone preparations, starting with the most recent one.  Information on the first hormone is recorded in Items 18 -23; information on the second in Items 24- 29; information on the third in Items 30 -35; information on the fourth in Items 36- 41.  Combination hormone preparations should be entered as one hormone with a \"/\" between the separate doses for the two hormones.  For example:     P    R    E   M    P    R    O  RHXAQxQ02232001   5    0    .6   2     5    /      2   .5    18, 24, 30, & 36.  Transcribe the name of the hormone.  Print clearly.  If the name is not known, draw two horizontal lines here and through the boxes for medication code, but attempt to complete the remaining questions.   When a hormone(s) is reported in Item 18a( Iitemes 24b, 30b, 36b), look it up in the List of Gonadal   Hormones  at the end of these instructions.  This list provides the location of the picture of the drug in the Physi cians Desk Reference (PDR), its MEDISPAN drug code, its trade and generic names and the possible concentrations.  If the participant has the hormo ne with her, use the labe l on the bottle in conju nction  with the list to determine and record the correct concentration (Items 18b, 24c and 36b).  If the label is not informative or if the participa nt has no bottle or pills, use the PDR picture to help determine the name and concentration.  Enter leading zeros if neces sary so the response is right justified.  All  valid concentrations are provided on the list .  Most hormones have multiple concentrations listed ; pick the correct one.  If the hormone is not on the list or cannot be found in the PDR , set the status field to Q (questionable).   Record the 6- digit medica tion code number (Items 18d, 24e, 30e and 36e) of the hormone just recorded.  If using a paper form, this item may be temporarily skipped and completed later.  In selecting the MEDISPAN code for a preparation with multiple hormones, identify the code based on the FULL NAME OF THE PRODUCT, not just the first hormone.   19, 25, 31 & 37.  If the participant started taking the specified hormone more than once, enter the age of the first time.  If not known, draw two horizontal lines through the boxes.   20, 26, 32 & 38.  \"Current\" means either in a cycle at the time of the interview or between cycles, or currently in a program of female hormone shots or implants.  If the response is YES, go to Item 22, 28, 34, 40).   21, 27, 33 & 39.  Enter the age at which she last stopped taking the specified hormone.  If not known, draw two horizontal lines through the boxes.   22, 28, 34 & 40.  Add together all the years and months during which the specified hormone was used.  If the participant's response sums to a total greater than the total number of years and RHXAQxQ02232001   6 remind the participant that \"we are looking for the length of time that you have ever used the hormone.\"  If the participant has used the hormone more than once, enter the total number of months or years used, not counting t he intervening periods of non-use.  This requires summing all the time intervals of usage.   23, 29, 35 & 41.  Enter the usual or most representative figure if it has varied over time.  If not known, draw 2 horizontal lines through the boxes.   24 - 29. These  items are repeats of Items 18 -23 for a second female hormone. If more than two hormones were used in the interim between the third and fourth examination, only record the two which were most recent.  This should not be confused with a single hormone preparation that consists of two hormones. If the participant only took one hormone, leave Item 24 blank and go to Item 42.   30  35. These items are repeats of Items 18- 23 for a third female hormone. If more than two hormones were used in the interim between t he third and fourth examination, only record the two which were most recent.  This should not be confused with a single hormone preparation that consists of two hormones. If the participant only took one hormone, leave Item 30 blank and go to Item 42.   36  41. These items are repeats of Items 18- 23 for a fourth female hormone. If more than two hormones were used in the interim between the third and fourth examination, only record the two which were most recent.  This should not be confused with a single hormone preparation that consists of two hormones. If the participant only took one hormone, leave Item 36 blank and go to Item 42.   D. Gynecologic Surgery   42 -43. If the participant is unsure, probe by suggesting that the uterus is also called the womb, and that in some places this is called a \"female operation.\"  It may be necessary in some cases to clarify that surgery to \"tack- up the bladder\"  is  different operation that does not involve the uterus nor ovaries.  It may also be necessary to suggest that the ovaries may be referred to as egg sacs.  If YES, enter Y and continue to the next question.  If NO or UNKNOWN, go to Item 47.   If necessary, suggest that the uterus is also called the womb.   44. Enter the age at which the uterus was removed.  If not known, draw 2 horizontal lines through the boxes.   RHXAQxQ02232001   7 45. The interviewer should probe to determine whether only one or both ovaries were removed.  Also note that with a vaginal hysterectomy (when the uterus is removed through the vagina and no abdominal incision is made), the ovaries are not removed.   Note :  \"Half\" an ovary should be recorded as no ovary removed.  If the response is NO or UNKNOWN, go to Item 35.   46. If more than one operation was performed, record the age of the most recent one.  If not know n, draw two horizontal lines through the boxes.   E. Administrative Information   47. Enter the date on which the participant was seen in the clinic.    48. Record \"C\" if the form was completed on the computerized data entry system, or \"P\" if the paper form was used.  If the form was completed partially on paper and partially on the computer, code as \"Paper Form.\"   49. Enter the 3 digit JHS code for the person at the clinic completing this form in the boxes provided."

            "Q": "RESPIRAT ORY SYMPTOMS FORM INSTRUCTIONS RPA VERSION A, 09/22/2000 QxQ Date 02/22/2001  I. GENERAL INSTRUCTIONS The Respiratory Symp toms fo rm is comp leted during the interview portion of the baseline clinic visit.  The intervie wer must  be certified and should  be familiar the data editing procedures for electronic version forms with and understand the document titled General Instructions for Completing Paper Forms prior completi ng this form.  ID number, Contact Year and Name are completed as described in that document. Information in quotes is to be read to the par ticipant.  Skip rules are enclosed in bo xes.  When after a brief explanation doubt remains as to whether the answer should be Yes or No, the answer should be rec orded as No. The Respir atory Symptoms form has  been adapted from the Epidemiology Standardiz ation Protocol and the s pecific instructions below are taken directly from that source.  Questions must be put to the parti cipant exactly as they  are printed; small changes may make unexpected large differences in responses.  Unequiv ocal answers are recorded as such, whether they seem re asonable o r not.  Probing questions should rarely be needed.  When they have to be asked, they should depart as little as possible form the working of the init ial question, and must not be  asked as to suggest any particular answer to the respondent.  II. SPE CIFIC INSTRUCT IONS A. Cough 1. Record if the participant usually has a cough.  Exclude clearing throat, but include a cough with first sm oke or going outside.  If  respondent answers No, skip 2 and 3. 2. This item assesses the fr equency of cough during a week.  3. This item assesses the chronicity of cough over the course of a year.  B. Phlegm 4. If the respondent answers No, skip to Item 7.  Emphasis should be placed upon phlegm as coming up from the chest and postnasal dis charge is discounted.  This may be determined by:  Do you raise it from your l ungs, or do you merely clear it from your throat ?  Some  subjects a dmit to bringing up phlegm without admitting to cough.  This claim should be accepted without c hanging the replies RPAA QxQ 0 2-22-2001   1 to cough.  Phlegm coughed up from the ch est counts as positive.  Include, if volunteered, phlegm with first smoke or on first going out-of-doors. 5. This item assesses frequency of  phlegm production dur ing a week.  6. This item assesses the chronicity of phlegm production over t he course of a year. C. Wheezing These questions are intended to identify subj ects who have occasional and/or  frequent wheez ing, exc luding asthma.  Those questi ons pertaining to asthma are asked in questions 13 through 17.  Subjects may confuse wheez ing with snoring or bubble sounds in the chest; a demonstration wheez e will he lp if further clarification is requested.  Can ask, Does your husband (or wif e) regularly complain of your wheez ing (not snoring) at night?  Ask question 7 and 8 of everyone; do not ask 9 if answers to 7 and 8 are No. Ask Item 10 0f everyone; do not ask Items 11 and 12 if the response is No. D. Asthma 13. If answer is No do not ask 14 through 17. 14. Record confirmation by a doctor.  15. Record the age of onset rounding down to the nearest whole number.  If the respondent  answers years, code it as 02.   For unknown, draw tw o horizontal lines through both boxes.  If a range is gi ven such as 5  7 years, use the midpoint of the range (6.5) and round down as indicated above (recording as 06). 16. Record whether partici pant is still asthmatic. 17. Do not ask Item 18 if Item 17 is Y es. 18. Record the age of cessation of as thma rounding down to the nearest whole number.  If the respondent ans wers years code it as 02.  For periods of less than 1 year, code as a zero.  For unknow n, draw two horizontal lines through both boxes .  If a range is given such as 5  7 years, use the midpoint of the range (6.5) and round down as indica ted above (recording as 06).  RPAA QxQ 0 2-22-2001   2 E. Breathlessness If a subject volunteers that he is disabled fr om walking by any condition other  than heart or lung dis ease, or obviously is c onfined to  a wheelc hair or uses crutches continuous ly, then questions 19  23 are not to be asked.  If  asked, the questions refer to the average condition during the preceding winters.  No attempt is gi ven to separate out cardiac breathless ness.  Read the items as printed and record Yes or No. F. Administrative Information 24. Enter the month, day and year  that the data was collected. 25. Record C if the form  was completed on the comput erized data entry syste m, or P if the paper form was used. 26.

            "Q": "Sitting Blood Pressu re Form Instructions  SBP Versi on A, 04/03/2000 QxQ Date 02/23/2001   I. GENERAL INSTRUCTIONS  The Sitting Bloo d Pressure (SBP) form is completed du ring the participant's baseline clinic visit. The technician mu st be certified and should have a working knowledge of Manual 4: Blood Pressure.  S/he should also be familiar with the data entry procedures for the electronic  version forms and understand the document titled \"General Instructions for Completi ng Paper Forms\" prior to completing this form.  ID Number, Contac t Year, and Name should be c ompleted a s described in that document.  There should be no exertion, eating, smok ing or expos ure to cold for one-half hour before recording blood pres sure.  It is  also important t hat the participant have no change of posture for five minutes before recording blood pressure.  Blood pressure is recorded twice usi ng a random zero s phygmomanometer. The detaile d ins tructions below for the admin istration of the SBP should be reviewed in combinat ion with the instructions fo r performing the measurements in Manual 2: Cohort Component Procedures , and in Manual 4: Blood Pressure.   II. SPE CIFIC INSTRUCT IONS  A. Temperature  1. Record the room temperature in degrees centigrade.  A thermometer is read and the temperature recorded each ti me the procedure is initiated to note fluctuations.  B. Tobacco and Caffeine Use  2. Ask the item as written.  Use of any type of smoking materials, chewing tobacco, snuff, nicotine gum, etc. today  or the current use of a nicotine patch should be noted.  If none we re used, skip to item 4.  3. Ask about the most recent time.  The item is phrased How long ago instead of At what time in order to  make it easier for the participant to answer.  Record the answer in the same way.  If the participant is wearing a nicotine patch, record 00 hour s (item 3a) and 00 mi nutes (3b).  If unknown, mark through the boxes with two horizontal lines.  4  5. Ask the items as written, following  the same procedures given for items 2  SBPA QxQ 02 -23-2001   1 and 3 abov e.  C. Preliminary Measurements  6. Measure right arm circumference once according to the directions  in Manual 4: Blood Pressure.  Reco rd to the nearest centimeter.  7. Cuff size is determined by arm ci rcumference measurement  in item 6.  The appropriate size for a given ar m circumference is given below, and also appears on the form itself.  Arm Circumference   Cuff Sizeunder 24 cm   Pediatric 24-32 cm   Regular Arm 33-41 cm   Large Arm over 41 cm   Thigh  8. Instruct the participant to sit qui etly, without changing her/his posture, while keeping both feet flat on the floor, for five minutes while you step out of the room. Start a timer, and retu rn promptly after 5 minutes have elapsed .  After the participant has sat quietly  for five min utes, meas ure the heart rate for 30 seconds (do not count for 15 seconds and multiply by two) and record the number in the spaces availa ble.  9. After recording the heart rate, enter  the time.  A five-minute wait with no change of posture must precede the fi rst blood pressure measurement.  10-11.  Record as described in Manual 4: Blood Pressure.  12. Calculate peak inflation level as  pulse obliteration pr essure + maximum zero + 30.  This is calculated autom atically when the form is entered on the computer.  (As a w ay of denoti ng this on the paper form, lines are provided rather than boxes for recording the result.)  D. First Blood Pressur e Measurement  13-14.  Me asure and record systolic and di astolic blood pressures as described in Manual 4: Blood Pressure.  Right  justify, using leading zeros if necessary.  15. Record the zero reading.  NOTE:  Do not calculate net blood pressure at this time.  E. Second Bl ood Pressure Measurement  SBPA QxQ 02 -23-2001   2 16-18. Repeat as in 13-15 above.  F. Computed  Net Average of First and Secon d Blood Pressure Measurements  19-20. Average systolic (item 19) and dias tolic (item 20) blood pressures are calculated automatically when the form  is entered on the computer. (As a way of denoting this on the paper form, lines are provided rather than boxes for recording the result.)   When the paper form is being used, the average of the first and se cond  reading for systolic and diastolic pre ssure must be calculated using a hand calculator. Use the works heet at the end of the fo rm to calculate items 19 and 20. items 13-18 are tran scribed onto that works heet in the specified spaces.

For example, if  the individual quit 6 months ago, but 2 months ago slipped and smoked 10 cigar ettes over a 2  3 day period, consider the person quit for 6 months. On the other hand, if the individual reports a quit attempt, but is now smoki ng with some regularity, albeit at a much lower  rate, such as a cigarette ev ery few days, or once every week or two, code question #3 as response 2. The evaluation of some level of regularity is  the important issue. TOBA QxQ 02-22-2001   1 Record the number of full months and years since the participant last smoked cigarettes in the boxes provi ded in 4a and 4b.  If the respondent has not smoked for 1-11 months, record  number of mont hs using leading zeros, if needed and \" 00\" years.  If >12 months, enter appropriate combination of years and months , using leading zeros as needed.  IF THE PARTICIPANT HAS SMOKED  CIGARET TES WITH THE PAST 3 MONTHS, SAY: Plea se answer the next few questions with regard to your current or recent cigarette smoking practices. IF THE PARTICIPANT HAS NOT SM OKED CIGARETTES WITHIN THE PAST 3 MONTHS, SAY: Pleas e answer the next few questions with regard to your usual cigarette smoking practices before you quit. 5. A day of smoking is a 24  hour per iod, from the time  one wakes up until just before waking up the next day. Thus, be sure  to count any smoking done during the night (more common in  very heavy smokers). For those individuals who have trouble appr oximating their cigarette in take, ask for the usua l or typical amou nt. If still difficult, ask how many s/he smoked yesterday, and the day before, and aver age. Be sure to ask the person if this amount is typical for them. A nother approach can be to ask when they bought their last pack, or last carton (10 packs), consider a daily rate based on how long it takes them to com plete the pack.  Recor d the total number of cigarettes the participant smokes per day.  Record  cigarette as 01.\"  Record any  smaller fraction of a cigarette as 00.\" 6. This question gets at the notion of ni cotine loading, that is, smoki ng more when one first awakens, in order to get blood nicotine levels up, often seen in heavier smokers. Ti me of awakening refers to the time at which the participant awakens from her/his longes t period of sleeping each day.  For most partici pants, this will occur in the morni ng.  Awakening after short napping periods should not be considered.  7. This item assesses the length of  time between awakening and the first cigarette.  Record the appropriate response based on the participants answer. Code the amount of time until the first cigarette i s usually s moked. If the participant replies t hat the ti me between her/his  awakening and her/his smoking varies, ask the participant to es timate the mo st common  time between her/his awakening and her/his smoking. For the participant who has trouble approximating, have the indiv idual briefly describe their routine prior to smoking, and then have the partici pant estimate the amount of time needed for those activities. 8. This item assesses the most diffi cult cigarette of the day to do without. Answer must be stated as a time/place/sit uation.  If participant states \"in the morning,\" when I get up, with my coff ee or a similar re sponse, clarify. This question is confusing to some individuals, who might answer, for TOBA QxQ 02-22-2001   2 examp le, with the brand of cigarettes they smoke. Others will hav e difficulty choosing a particular cigarette, and will respond with several preferred smoking times, or say \"all of them.\" Another way to ask the question is, \"if you had one cigarette to smoke during the day, when would you s moke it?\" Be careful not to lead the individual to the \"first of the day\" response. If the person responds, \"in the morning,\" have th em clarify by asking, \"when in the morning?\" 9. This item gets at the difficulty an individual has abstaining from smoking in an environment where it is forbidden. The specific situation is not the critical component , so you may offer other suggestions, such as, \"at a friends house who does not permit smoki ng,\" \"at wo rk,\" or the like. If participant is unsure as to whether s/he finds (found) it difficult to refrain from smoking in places wh ere it is forbidden, ASK THE PART ICIPANT: Have you e ver smoked in a place where it is forbidden,  for example, in church, th e library, cinema, etc.? 10. This question address es the indiv iduals perc eived need to smoke even when they are feeling poorly.  Mild illn esses, such as head colds, that did not require the participant to be in bed for most of the day should not be included. 11. This item assesses the usual num ber of cigarettes per day over the participants entire history of smoking.   It will likely prod uce the same number given to item #4 for most par ticipants. However, for those whose daily rates have changed on a relative ly per manent basis (for example, unsuccessful at quitting, but has cut back and maintained a reduced rate), this will giv e us a better long  term esti mate of cigarette rate.  Record the average number of whole cigarettes t he parti cipant smoked per day.  If the participant is unsure, help the participa nt to remember by asking her/him the time of day and situations in whic h s/he would normally smoke.  Record 01 if  cigarette per day; \"00\" for anything else.  12. Years off cigarettes includes on ly those periods during which the participant did not smoke any cigarette s.  A time period in whic h the participant reduced the number of cigare ttes per day should not be included. Add up all those periods of time during whic h the participant had stopped regular smoking. Subt ract this number from the total time since beginning to smoke (Current age minus age w hen began to smoke regularly). 13. This item assesses depth of inhalation.  READ THE RESPONSE CATEGORIES ONE AT A TIME.  Re cord the manner in which the participant inhaled cigarette smoke.  If the participant is unsure, ask the participant to consider how deeply s/he breathes (breathed) when smoking cigarettes. TOBA QxQ 02-22-2001   3 14. This question pertains  to multiple or  continuous use of any tobacco product other than cigarettes.  An y regular use indicates the need to ask items 15  26. Regular use, in thi s case, should be inter preted liber ally. Accept  any indication of systema tic use, even if only once every week or so. S ome individuals go through phases wh ere they will smoke 2  3 cigars per week, and then none for a w hile. Derive as accurate an average as you can. If the participant reports no usage or single us age of a tobacco product, record No and proceed to Item 27. 15. This question pertains  to multiple or continuo us use of cigars or cigarillos.  Record the total number of years t he participant has smoked cigars  or cigarillos regularly. Arrive at an approxim ate total years of use. Subtract age began use from current age, and then subt ract any significant periods of time where no use of this form of tobacco  occurred.   If  00, go to Item 18. 16. Record the number of cigars or ci garillos the participant has smoked per week.  Do not include the number of other tobacco products such as cigarettes or snuff/dip . 17. Record Yes if the participant CU RRENTLY smokes cigars or cigarillos.  Record No otherwise.

GENERAL INSTRUCTIONS  The Hassles and Mood Inventory is completed by  the participant in their home after the baseline clinic visit.  If there is time and the participant desires, it can be completed during the baseline clinic visit.  The statem ent below should be read to all participants before providing them with the Hassles and Mood take home ques tionnaires.   General St atement to  Participants  We are asking that you complete this packe t of questionnaires at home.  In the packet are questions about how much stress you are under, your mood, and how you typically deal with strong emotions, such as anger.  We  are interested in your answers to these questions because we want to find out whet her stress and strong emotions are related to heart disease.  This packet  has several parts to i t.  At the beginning of each  part, there will be instructions telling you how to answer the ques tions.  Please take y our time to answer each question carefully .  Please do not skip any questions.  There are no right or wrong answers.  We are interested in your feelings and opinions.  If you do not understand the instructions for one of the questi onnaires or do not understand one of the questions, please tell the Jackson Heart Study staff me mber when they come to pick up your packet.  They will be ha ppy to help you.  Thank you for filling out these questio nnaires.  Picking-up the Questionnaires  When picking up the Take Home Questionnaires, check to make sure that all items on each questionnaire were answered.   If there are blank items,  off the participant the opportunity  to complete the item(s).  Mr. Or  Mrs. Participant, Ive noticed that some of the questions were left blank.  Would you mind  answering these for me now.  If the participant left the items blank intentionally, the interviewe r should exp lain the rationale to the parti cipant again, and reassure the par ticipant about confidentiality.  If the participant does not feel comfortable answe ring the questions for some reason, this should be noted and the partici pant thanked for pointing out their concerns. WSIA-CESA-CH OA-S TXA QxQ 02-23-2001  1 Answering  Participants Questio ns  Participant s may have questions about particula r items.  The interviewer should read the item again and provide a neut ral prompt, such as Answer whats right for you or Answer what makes the most sense to you.  Most of the terms used in the various rating scales (e.g., almost ne ver, almost always, most of the time, rarely, etc. ) are left to the participants s ubjective perception of what these mean.  If the parti cipant has a question about the scaling on a particular questionnaire, the interviewer should provide only neutral information, such as Use it the way you would normally use it in conver sation.  Remind the participant that there are no right or wrong answers to the question s, and that we are si mply interested in their views.  If the participant has questions about a particular item or requires assistance completing the questionnaire (illiteracy or visual deficit),  keep in mind that many of these questions are quite personal, and may be perceived as  sensitive or potentially  embarrassing to the participant.  Read all questions in  a neutral, non-judgmental tone.  When the response categories are repetitive (such as True or False or Yes or No), and the participant appears to understand t he questions and provides reasonable answers, the interviewer may choose not to read the response categories to every question.

            "Q": "BODY COMPOSITION FORM INSTRUCTI ONS BCF VERSION A: 08/15/2005 QxQ Prepared: 08/30/2005    I. General Instructions  The Body Composition Form (B DF) form is  completed during the fixed sequence #1 of the participant's Exam 2 visit to record the results of measuring height, weight, waist and neck circumference and body composition (body fat, free fat mass, impedance.  The technician must  be certified and should have a working knowledge of the data entry  procedures for el ectronic version forms and the document titled \"General Instructi ons for Completing Paper Forms\" prior to completing this form.  ID  Number, Contact Year, and Name should be completed as described in that document. BCF is performed before the clinic snack and after offering the participant an opportunity  to empty her/his bladder.  S ee Table 4.1-4.3 in Manual 2: Cohort Procedures  for instructions on how to convert to and from metric measures.  II. Specific Instructions  A. Preliminar y Information This section is intended to determine information that may impact measurements taken during Exam 2. It is important  to have general inf ormation regarding the participants hydration status as well as  their activity level as a basis for interpreting anthropometric, body compos ition, and blood pr essure measures.  1. Determine the time when the participant last had anything to drink (including water). Whi le the person was to be fasting fo r the clinic visit, s/he could drink water. Ask the partici pant to try to recall as closely as possible the exact time of last fluid intake. Record time using a 24- hour clock.  2. Determine whether the participant  had had any alcoholic beverage within the past 48 hours, recording Dont Drink Alcohol, Yes, or No.  3. This item is intended to determi ne if the participa nt has engaged in physical activity within the past 12 hours. Moderate physical activit y includes sustained phy sical activi ty (walking, household cleaning, gardening or yard work, etc) of 10 minutes. Vigorous physical activity BCF Version A ( 08/31/2005 ) includes sustained phy sical activit y of 20 minutes or more that raises the heart rate and results in sweat from  exertion (walking , running, bik ing, heavy yard work, etc ). Record Yes or No.  4. For WOMEN ONLY, determine menstrual  cycle within the past two weeks. Only ask this item if t he participant is 55 years of age or younger. If age 55 years or older, record N o longer menstruating.   B. Girth  Measurements   Girth measurements are to be taken against the skin or  over light weight non-constricting underwear . 5. (Waist) Ask the participant to sta nd with the feet apar t and the weight equally dist ributed while the waist is m easured. Place the tape horizontally at the level of the umbi licus (navel) as depicted in Figur e 4.4, Manual 2: Cohort  Procedures.  Record the resu lts to the nearest inch, rounding down.  6. (Hip) The objective here is to meas ure the maximal circumference of the gluteal (hip) muscles. Ask the partici pant to stand with the feet apart and the weight equally dist ributed while t he hip is measured. Refer to the anatomic figure (Figure 4.5) in Manual  2 for the proper placement of the measuring tape. Place the tape ho rizontally around the participants gluteal mus cles (hips) at the level of  maximal protrusion.  The position is verified by passing the tape measure above and below the observed maximum.  The measuring tape must be kept  horizontal throughout this procedure. Record the results to the nearest inch, rounding down.   The next item is intended to record the par ticipants inc lusion in the comparability study to determine the equivalenc e of the balance beam  scale and the Tanita Bioimpedance Monitor in m easuring height and weight. 7. If the participant is NOT included in the comparability study and the height, weight and BMI are measured by  the balance beam and wall mounted metal tape, record Balance beam/Wall Only. Compete Section C following, skipping Section D. The administrative section should correspond by indicating that me asures were made In clinic. If the participant is NOT included in t he comparability study and the height, weight, and BMI are measured by  the Tanita Bioimpedance Monitor only, record Tanita body composition only. Skip to Section D. The administrative section should correspond and, in most i nstances, indicate that measures were made Off site. If the measures we re made in clinic with the Tanita, please indicate in the notes the reason this was do ne.  BCF Version A ( 08/31/2005 ) If the participant IS included in the co mparability study, record Both and continue to complete BOTH Section C and Section D.   C.  Balance Beam/Wall Measurements 8. Be sure that the participant's head is  in the Frankfort horizontal plane as described in Figure 1, Manual 2: Cohort Procedures.  Record the height to the nearest feet (8a) and inch (8b) using leading zeroes if necessary, and rounding up for 0.5 or abov e.  Round down otherwise.  9. Weight is taken with minimal clot hing.  Record results to the nearest pound, rounding up for 0.5 or abov e.  Round down other wise.  10. Body Mass Index is automatica lly calculated by the computer   D. Tanita Measurements 11.   Using the instructions provided in  Manual 2, Section 4. 1.2.2, Enter Body Type. Select from one of the four body types: Standard or Athletic. For most partici pants, you will select t he Standard mode. The Athletic key should be used for individuals over the age of 17 and under the following conditions: o Tanita defines athlete as a person involv ed in intense physical activity of at least 10 hours per week and who has a resting heart rate of approximately 60 beats per mi nute or l ess. Tanitas athlete definition includes lifet ime of fitness indivi duals who have been fit for years but currently exerci se less than 10 hours per week. Tanitas at hlete definit ion does not include enthusiastic beginner s who are making a real commitment to exercising at leas t 10 hours per week but whose bodies have not yet changed to the required Athlete mode.   12. Be sure that the participant's head is  in the Frankfort horizontal plane as described in Figure 1, Manual 2: Cohort Procedures.  Record the height to the nearest foot and nearest inch us ing leading zeroes if necessary. Round up for 0.5 or above. Round down otherwise.  13. Weight is taken with minimal clot hing.

            "Q": "HEALTH HISTORY FORM INSTRUCTIONS  HHX VERSION A: 08/16/2005 QxQ Prepared : 08/30/2005    I. GENERAL INSTRUCTIONS  The Health History (HHX) is administered by trained interviewers during the flexible component of the Exam 2 clin ic visit. It collects information on the participants health status, personal health  history and family health history and  is a follow up of the Personal and Family  Health History (PFH) collected during the Home Induction Interview during Exam 1. The exact wording and order of the questions should be followed to ensure st andardization. Questions should not be skipped unless indicated by the skip patte rn instructions.  Because there are several skip patterns in this section, the interviewer should be very familiar with the flow of the questions to insure smoot h administration with a conversational tone. The interviewer must be certif ied and have working knowledge of the document General Instructions for Comp leting Paper Forms prior to completing this form.  ID Number, Contact Y ear and Name should be completed as described in this form.  Initiate the form  by reading the scrip t at the beginning of the form as printed.   II. SPECIFIC INSTRUCTIONS  Health  Status  1. This standardized question is intended to assess the participants assessment of their overall health status in comparison with other persons in their same age range. Record the response provided by the respondent. 2. This standardized question is intended to assess the participants assessment of how their current heal th status compares with their perception of what it wa s one year ago. The time frame is one year prior to the date of the Exam 2 clinic visit. Record the response provided by the respondent.  3. This item is intended to provide self-report data regarding birth weight. Probe to the closest pounds and ounces that the participant can recall. Ask them to think about what their mo ther or father may have told them about their birth weight and encourage them to recall as closely as possible. Record using leading zeros as needed.  4. Having been breast fed may be pr otective for heart disease, and may have an impact on adult weight and other chronic health conditions. Ask the respondent to think back to what their parents told them about their infancy and record respondents response. 4b. If the respondent was breast fed, as her/him to try and recall the length of time that they were breast fed. Record her/his response using the closest response category. If the participant is hesitant in her/his answer, read the responses to the participants saying, Would you say.. 5. FOR WOMEN ONLY: Ask if she has ev er had a tubal ligation, that is one or more of her tubes tied. Record as responded. 5b. If YES--- ask the respondent to recall the age at which she had a tubal ligation. Record to the nearest year, using leading zeros as needed. 6. FOR WOMEN < 55 YEARS ONLYThis item is intended to determine current pregnancy. Record as responded 7. FOR MEN ONLY: Ask if he has ev er had a vasectomy. Record as responded.  B. Personal Health Problems This next set of items is intended to determine NEW health problems since the last JHS examination. This is a series  of questions regarding particular health conditions diagnosed by a health care pr ovider. Remind the participant of the date of the Exam 1 visit and ask them to  think about the time frame from that point to the present date. Continue to remind them throughout the questioning process that you are referring to NEWLY DIAGNOSED health problems occurring in the time period betw een JHS Exam 1 and JHS Exam 2.   For each of the specified conditions, ask the participant if a health care provider has told them that they have that condition SINCE THE LAST JHS EXAM. Enter YES, NO or UNSURE/UNKNOWN for each item that identifies a specific condition. A response is positive (YES) only if the condition was diagnosed by a health care provider. A diagnosis of borderline is coded as YES if the participants condition was diagnosed by a heal th care provider as borderline. For example, a participant may tell you that  My doctor told me I have borderline diabetes or My doctor said I had a touch of sugar.   NO is recorded is (1) the respondent was to ld by a health care provider that s/he did not have the condition specified, (2) was nev er told by a health care provider that s/he had the condition, or (3) was never tested for the condition.  UNSURE/UNKOWN is recorded if the respondent  is not sure that the health care provider said s/he had this condition. The code of UNSURE/UNKNOWN is most frequently used when the respondent cannot remember accurately what the health care provider said. Do not defi ne the condition yourself based on the respondents answer. Record ambiguo us responses in a note log.   For each YES response, enter the age at wh ich the respondent was first told of this condition by a health care provider  (PLEASE NOTE: If the age of first diagnosis is out of the time  range for this item, e.g. , since the last JHS Examclarify with the participant whether this is actually a NEW diagnosis since the date of Exam 1]. If the respondent does not remember the exact age or year which a health care provider first told her or him of the condition, ask for and record a best estimate of the age.

Items 9 through 14 refer to the usual charac teristics of the pain and discomfort.  Unequivoc al answers need not be probed; but  answers such as occasionally or sometimes should be probed by a question of the type:  Does this happen on most occasions ?  Skip rules must be adhered to.  9. The answer must be interpreted strictly .  If pain is exper ienced only  during some other form of exer tion (e.g. cycling, stair c limbing, lawn mowing), it must be recorded as No.\"  10. Record if the participant has c hest pain while  walkin g.  If NO, DONT KNOW, REFUSED, OR MISSING, skip to Item 29.  11. Record what the parti cipant does  if chest pain occurs while walkin g.

Indicate the shortest applicable time interval, but not one that is less than the actual span of time.  For exampl e, 7 months ago should be rec orded as WITHIN THE PAST 1 YEAR.  20 - 28. All questions apply only to the past 2 months  (that is, 6 0 days prior to the MHX B QxQ_08 112005   2 clinic visit).  Therefore, this phr ase is repeated with eac h question (except Items 21 and 24, for smoothness).  C.  Possible Infarction  29 - 36. Ask questions exactly  as printed.  Skip rules must be observed for the questions to make sense.  33 - 34. Both questions refer o nly to heart attacks for which the participant was hospitalized one week  or more (as stated in Item 32).  If not known, draw 2 horizontal lines through the box(es).  35. The question refers to an exercis e test; therefore, a resting ECG would not apply.  D.  Intermittent Claudication  37 - 46. Ask questions exactly  as they ar e printed; interpret answers strictly.  39 - 41. These questions refer to the usual characteristics of pa in or discomfort.  Unequivoc al answers need not be probed, but answers such as occasionally or sometimes should be probed by a question of the type:  Does this happen on most occasions?  Skip rules must be adhered to.  E.  Congestive Heart Failure  47 - 49. These questions are prefaced by the phrase, Have you ever , thus it is not necessary that the condition be habitual.   49.

This can take plac e at the reception station or while the participant proceeds with the clinic visit.  As the participant de livers  the medications, indicate wh ere (and by whom) they will be re turned before s/he leaves.  Mention that medication names will be copied from the labels, and that if required, medications will be taken out of their c ontainer only in the presence o f, and with approval of , the participant.  Finally, in dicate that a trai ned in terviewer will later ask a few questions about each medication.  Verify that the medications bag is clearly identified wit h the participant' s name.  Do not open the medications bag or  transcribe medications until the participant has signed the informed consent. If the response is SOME OF TH EM, go to Item 3a to make arrangements with the participant to obtain the information for t hose medications which were not brought; transcribe those medic ations whic h were brought in Sec tion B (MEDICATION TRANSCRIPTION).  The pref erred arrangement is follow up with the participant by telephone on the day of the clinic visit.  If  that is not possible, arrangements should be made to follow up with the partici pant by telephone on another date.  If the response is NONE (FORGOT/UNABL E TO BRING MEDICATIONS), reassure the respondent with the stat ement Thats alright.  Since the information on medication s is so important, we would still like to ask you about it during the interview.  Clarify that t hey did indeed take medication s in the past two weeks and MSR B QxQ_08 112005(1 )  Page 2 of 19 go to Item 3a to make arrangements to obtai n the information for those medic ations which were not brought.   3a.

Medica tions Transcription  Section B (MEDICATI ON TRANSCRIPTION) is  divided into three components to document information about each medicati on used by the participant: (1) Transcription, (2) Intervie w, and (3) Medication Coding.   Transcription inc ludes recording in column (a) the medi cation name,  in column (b) concentration (strength), and in column (c) the i nstructions for admin istration of each medication used within the two weeks prior to the interview.  T he interview portion consists of determining and recording in colum n (d) whether the medi cation was taken within the last 24 hours and (e) why the patient is taking t he medication (e.g. for blood pressure, sugar, arthritis, etc).  Medication Codes  are coded using the DMS version of the MEDISPAN Medication Dictionary and recorded in column (f) (this column is not included on paper version of form).  The transcription of the medication name (column a), concentration (colum n b), and inst ructions for administration (column c) is done by a trained transcriptionist prior to the interview with the participant or by an interviewer in conjunction with the administration of the ques tions in column (d).  The coding of the medications from the DMS medication dic tionary is done later by a trained coder after the interview is  completed.  Begin this process by opening the medicati ons bag and removing all medications.  In column (a), transcribe the medication name (in BLOCK LETTERS if using a paper form), followed by the concentration in colum n (b), and instructions for administration in column (c), beginning with Item 4.  In clude all parts of the medication nam e and any numbers and/or letters that identify the strength (concentration).  For keying purposes, the following format should be used when transcribing the medication name and concentration.  For example:  Column (a)      Column (b)AMPICILLIN     250 mg AMPICILLIN LIQUID   125mg/5ml NOSTRIL      1/2 % ANACIN MAXIMUM STRENGTH  =====  Also copy any numbers and codes which follow or are part of  the name.  For example:   ANACIN-3    STUARTNATAL 1 + 1  ACEROLA C (100 MG)  ILETIN I N PH  TRIAMINIC12   S-K AMPICILLIN  OVRAL28    CALT RATE 600 + VITAMIN D  ORTHO-NOVUM 10/11-28  If in doubt, it is preferable to add information that may be insign ificant.  This will he lp later in identifying (and coding) a medication. MSR B QxQ_08 112005(1 )  Page 4 of 19  To facilitate  the recordi ng process some standard abbreviations ha ve been establishe d.

Do not use ditto marks (\") to indicate a repeat of a previous item.  MSR B QxQ_08 112005(1 )  Page 6 of 19 Sometimes the drug name includes numbers or letters which could be mistaken for dosage.  Having these numbers or letters as part of the drug name helps in selecting the appropriate code.  T herefore, it is better to record  all the information related to medication name and concentration on the fo rm in a standard format.  The following guidelines are offer ed for standardization.  Medication Transcription   * Print complete names using block  capital letters.    * Record all identifying c haracters and numbers referring to concentration.  * Record instructions for administrati on completely as written on the labels using standardized abbr eviations if desired.    * Include as much identifying information as possible.  Sometimes the dosage form may appear to be part of the drug name since a few companies have trademarks for their dosag e forms.  For exam ple, Enseals for enteric coated tablets and Kapsea ls or Pulv ules for capsules.  You may record these names as identifying information.  Combination Drugs   Combination medicines contain two or more drugs in a single pill  or tablet.  Some combination medicines such as Dyazid e come in only one fixed combination (hydrochlorothiazide 25 mg and triamter ene 50 mg); these combination medicines do not generally list the strengt h.  Record DYAZIDE, in  the space medication name and do not record anything for concentration.  Other combination medicines such as Inderide are availa ble in more than one fixed dose combination (propranolol 40 mg and hy drochlorothiazide 25 mg; or propranolol 80 mg and hydrochlor othiazide 25 mg); thes e combination medicines generally list the strength as in \"Inderide 40/25\" or \"Inderi de 80/25.\"  For these medicines, record, for example, INDERIDE, in the space fo r name, and \"40/25\" or \"80/25\" after the name as the concentrati on.  For example:  Drugs containing two or  more me dications:   Example of fixed dosage:   Dyazide (hydrochlorothiazide and triamterene) code \"DYAZIDE\"   Examples of variable dosage: Inderide 40/25 (40 mg Inderal, 25 mg hydrochlorothiaz ide) code \"INDERIDE 40/25\"  MSR B QxQ_08 112005(1 )  Page 7 of 19 Inderide 80/25 (80 mg Inderal, 25 mg hydrochlorothiaz ide) code \"INDERIDE 80/25\"  * Do not record flavors of products and whether the preparat ions are sugar-free or sodium-free.  Concentration   Most drug concentrations are given in grams,  milligrams or microg rams.  Record as written on the labe l using the abbreviations \"gm\" for grams, \"mg\" for milligrams and \"mcg\" for micrograms.  Rarely the dos age may be given in grain s.  Use the abbreviation \"gr\" for this.  When strength is not recorded as  milligra ms (mg) record all numb ers, digits and characters used to denote concentration; thi s includes:   .  -  decimal point    gm  =  gram(s) ml  -  milliliter    gr    =  grain(s) /ml  -  per milliliter    mg  =  milligram mEq  -  millie quivalents    mcg =  microgram hr  -  hour /hr  -  per hour %  - percent   Note: When the abbreviati on, \"PC\" (percent) is used, record percent symbol, \"%.\"  SPECIFICS:  * Record strength of combination drugs  where strength i s separated by a \"/\" here.  * Liquid medicine conce ntration is o ften written in mg/ml (milligrams per milliliter).  For example , Ampicilli n 125 mg /5 ml, is recorded as: \"AMPICILLIN for name and 125 mg/5ml\" for concentration.  * Concentration for some medicines ma y be w ritten as a percentage.  For example: Alupent 0.6%, is recorded as:  \"ALUPENT  for name and 0.6%\" for concentration  * Concentration for insulin is genera lly \"U10 0\" or 100 units per millilit er.\"  This is often written as \"100/ml\" or \"100U/ml. \"  Record Insulin concentration as \"U100\" unless another strength is listed on the label.  NOTE:  Do not record the quantity or  number of pills/tablets dispen sed.  If more than 26 medications are present or reported by the participant, only 26 medications are coded and keyed, selected according to the priorities described MSR B QxQ_08 112005(1 )  Page 8 of 19 below. If it i s necessary to defer the assi gnation of priorities for medications to be transcribed, the name and str ength of each additional medication is  recorded on the back of page 3 of the paper form, until 26 medication names are selected for transcription and coding.  Medications ma y be prioritiz ed during transcription by combining the transcription and interview components.  Prioritization is performed only if there are more than 26 medications and is based on the following algorit hm: prescri ption m edications first; then aspirin, aspirin-containing medications and anti-inflammatory  preparations (aspirin, Alka-Selt zer, headache powders, cold medicine, medication for arthritis); follo wed by other over-the-counter preparations; then vitami ns and food supplements and any other medications last.

The date on which the medications are coded is enter ed in Item 28c.  Return the medications to the carrier bag.  If the interview por tion has not been administered, place the MSR paper form (if appropriate) in the medica tion bag and take the medication bag to a secure location for use at t he workstation in which the in terview will be admin istered.  If the interview portion of t he form has been administered, take the bag to a secure place for returning to the parti cipant at the medical dat a review workstation.

Determine from Item 28 on the form at the end of Section B whether  there are any medications in the bag for which the receptionist was unable to transcribe the name/concentration.  These may include unmarked containers, loos e pills, and containers with more than one medic ation.  Ask the participant to  open any unmarked containers, and to handle loos e pills.  With the participant's help  and using a Physicia ns Desk Reference (PDR), attempt to identify these m edications.  If possible,  enter the name and concentration, and ask if t he medication was taken in t he last 24 hours.  If the medication cannot be identified,  write UNKNOWN for the m edication name and draw two horizontal lines through the boxes (enter  \"=\" in the spaces) for the medication code number.  If additional medic ations can be transcribed, adjust the total for Item 28. \"Number of medications una ble to transcribe:\", accord ingly.  After this has been completed for all containers, prescripti ons and medications in the bag, probe the participant on whether  all medications taken in the previous two weeks are included.  For any additional medications recalled by  the participant, record the names and answer the questions with as much detail as  possible.  If there is any doubt, arrange for a review during the 24-hour pick up or phone call during whic h the participant can provide acc urate information.  During the rest of the Medication Survey interview or during a subsequent interview, the participant may recall other medication s or vitamins taken during the past two weeks.  Their name, concentrations, and instructions for administration, are transcribed in columns (a), (b), and (c),  respectively, and last ingestion (use) is recorded in column (d) at this time, just as  if they had been in the medication bag.  Howev er, the number of medications in the bag is not changed . This documents that information on some medications were pr ovided from the participant's memory.  Column E. Reason for Taking Medication  Record verbatim the reason that the partici pant gives for taking this medication. If s/he does not know, record DONT KNOW. Or  if s/he refuses to respond, record REFUSE D. If the item is legiti mately missing, record MISSING.   Column (f). CODE NUMBER. (N OT VISIBLE ON PAPER FORM)  The 14-digit medication code numbers ar e found in the DES version of the Medication Dictionary which has been distri buted to the Exam Center.  The drug MSR B QxQ_08 112005(1 )  Page 12 of 19 names are listed in alphabet ical order.  Drug names t hat begin with a number, ditto (\"), or a dash (-) are listed first.  If a drug name is separated by a hyphen, the portion of the name preceding the hyphen is  listed in alphabetical order.  If you encounter a drug name which is not in the dictionary, do not guess at a match.  Simply set the status code to Q (questi onable) so that the pharmacist at the Coordinating Center can develop a code number and update the dictionary.  Numbers that appear in the di ctionary are used to differ entiate between products.  Before coding a drug entry, determine whet her the numbers which are recorded are part of the name or are str ength/concentration information.  Numbers referring to strength/concentration are not  used in the matching proce ss for medication coding.  Some drug products use a suffix to di stinguis h between combination products containing the same primar y drug.  For example:    Darvon = propoxyphene hydrochloride   Darvon N = propoxyphene napsylate   Darvon Cmpd = propoxyphene hy drochloride with aspirin and caffeine   Darvon wit h ASA = propo xyphe ne hydrochloride and a spirin  When coding a medication whic h contains more than one word, look for a match of the entire name in the dict ionary.  If the name matc hes, enter the corresponding code.  If a complete match cannot be found, but the dictionary has a single entry for the ingredient(s) in the medication (usua lly the first word of the drug name), and there are no other entries containing this word , select the corresponding code.  This occurs most often when:  both the brand and generic name are transcribed, but only one is given in the dictionary;  the form of the drug is  transcribed, but not gi ven in the dictionary;  the seller's name is transcribed, but  is not listed in the dictionary.  It is critical that the other words in  the transcribed drug name do NOT involve additional ingredients.    Examples:  CORDARONE/AMIODARONE not in the dictionary; code as AMIODARONE, whic h is listed.  DIMETAPP ELIXIR not in the dictionary; code as DIMETAPP , which is listed.    ECKERD ALLERGY  not in the dictionary; code   RELIEF TABS   as ALLERGY RELIEF, MSR B QxQ_08 112005(1 )  Page 13 of 19        w hich is listed.  TYLENOL NO. 3 not in the dictionary; cannot code, since \"NO.3\" could designate another ingredient; in fact, it designates codeine. It can be coded by searching for the abbreviation of Tylenol's ingredient wit h codeine: APAP W CODEINE, which is in the dictionary.  In order to put drug nam es on the prescription label, pharmacists may use abbreviations.  Unfortunately, these abbrev iations are often not standardized.  Some frequently used abbreviations, however, occur in the Medication Dictionary.  For example:   APAP =  acetami nophen   HC =  hydrocortisone  ASA =  aspirin    HCI =  hydrochloride  CAFF  =  caffeine    HCTZ  =  hydrochlorothiazide  Cl =  chloride    IV =  intravenous  CMP  =  compound    K =  potassium  COD =  codeine    M =  minerals  DM =  dextromethorphan  SR =  sustained release  Fl =  fluoride    T =  therapeutic  GG =  glyceralguiacolate  XR =  extended release  C.  In terview  This portion of the Medication Survey is  administered by  the nurse-clinician or a trained interviewer.  For Item  30, ask if medications were tak en in the past tw o weeks for the nine lis ted reasons.  The following synony ms may be given in response to participant questions.  a. High blood pressure = hypertension c. Angina or chest pain = heart pains d. Control of heart rhythm = medicine for fast or irregular heart rate or heart beats e. Heart failure = congestive heart failure, not heart attack f. Blood thinning = anticoagulation i. Leg pain when walk ing = claudic ation  NOTE:  Str oke does not  include TIA nor \"slight strokes\" which last ed less than 24 hours.  MSR B QxQ_08 112005(1 )  Page 14 of 19 For example, if the parti cipant had taken medication for high blood pressure and claudication and no other listed conditions,  Item 29 would be coded as follows:   29. Were any of the medications you took during the past two weeks for:       [If \"Yes ,\" verify  that m edication name is on medication record.]               Dont           Yes No Know    a.  High Blood Pressure     Y N D   b.  High Blood Choles terol     Y N D   c.  Angina or Chest Pain     Y N D   d.  Control of Heart Rhythm    Y N D   e.  Heart Failure       Y N D   f.  Blood Thinning      Y N D   g.  Diabetes or High Blood Sugar    Y N D   h .  Stroke       Y  N D   i.  Leg pain when walk ing     Y N D   If any of the conditions are answered affirmat ively, be sure that the medication is recorded in Section B.  The interviewer, however, can not  ask the participant to identify which medication was used to treat any of the conditions.   For example, if the participant reported taking a medicati on to lower blood pressure during the last two weeks (Item 29.a), and no re cogniz able antihy pertensive medications were recorded in Sect ion B and the participant did not give blood pressure as a reason for taking any of the medications transcribed from her/h is medication bag, the interviewer may probe to determine if  the names of all medications taken during the last two weeks were recorded.  If the person indicates that the names of all her/his medications have been tran scribed, the interviewer can not probe further to determine which medic ation was used to treat the high blood pressure. The interviewer can however say somethi ng similar to: You did not mention that any of your medication bottles were a m edicine for blood pressure. Was that an oversight or is it possible that you left t hat medication at home?  If they left the medication at home, go back to Item 2 and 3 to indicate that not all medication s MSR B QxQ_08 112005(1 )  Page 15 of 19 were brought, and determine a time for follow up.   D. Medication Taking Behaviors  This section is obtains  information on t he participants usual medic ation-taking behaviors, or taking medica tions as prescribed.  Item 30 is asked of all participants regardle ss of whether they reported taking any medication during the past two weeks or whet her they brought day medication to the Exam Center.  This question is asked as worded.  Explan ation about memory jogging or thinking of times when they hav e taken prescription medications in the past may be offered at the beginning of this  question.  Read each item in the list and indicate whether the item was indicated or not as a reason for taki ng medications exactly as prescribed.  For example, if the parti cipant had indicated they had not taken medications according to directions  by reason of not lik ing to take me dicine s and that it made them feel bad, Item 30 would be c oded as follows: MSR B QxQ_08 112005(1 )  Page 16 of 19           R eason  N ot a  Dont         Indicate d Reason  Know a.

Although the primary pur pose of Item 31 is to identify participants who are taking aspir in, the question is broadly constructed to include aspirin and other medications which may contain aspirin but are not necessarily labeled as aspirin, such as \"Alka-Seltzer, cold medicine or headache powder.\"  Therefore, this question may identify per sons taking medications which do not include aspirin.  32. Read the transition statement and Ite m 32 to all participants who responded YES to Item 32.  We are after the current use (NOW ) of aspirin or aspirin containing medication on a REGULAR basis , regardless of the reason for its use.  These medications do not include Tyle nol, Advil, etc.  Consult the list of Aspirin or Aspirin Containing Medications at the end of these instructions if in MSR B QxQ_08 112005(1 )  Page 17 of 19 doubt.  If asked by the participant, \"regular\" is defined as at least once a week  for several months.  If the response is \"NO or UNKONWN skip to Item 34.  When the response is Yes, continue by asking Item 33a.  33a. Read the question and select the appropr iate letter from the four response codes.  Strength refers to the number of milligrams of aspirin per pill, not the total number of milligr ams taken.  (Buffe red aspirin doe s not refer to strength, but to added ingredie nts.)  The participant  may offer the actual milligrams, which can be categorized as shown in t he responses.  If the person can recall that the strength of the pill was not  baby, but can not di stinguish b etween regular and extra strength, code as regul ar, 'B.'  If the participant does not remember at all, record DONT K NOW.  33b. Read the question.  The purpose of  this question is to document the number of days per week aspirin is taken .  Record the typical frequency (i.e., \"on average\") of the aspirin that is used on a regular basis.  If less than one day per week, record as zero.  Round half days up to the next integer.  The maximum number of days per week is 7.  33c. Read the question.  In cont rast to part (b), the purpose of this question is to document the average number  of aspirin tablets t he person takes during a typical wee k.  'Pills' refers to both aspi rin and  aspirin con taining me dications, either in tablet or powder form.  If >99, reco rd as 99.  If < 1, record as zero.  If \"half tablets\" were used, divide the number of half tablets by 2 and round fractions up to the next integer.  For exam ple, record the use of 7 half tablets of aspirin per week as 04.  33d. Read the question.  Do not read the c hoices.   If the parti cipant mentions avoiding heart attack or stroke as part of her/his respons e, record \"H.\"  Individuals could be followi ng the advice of their provider of medical care in doing this, or they could be acting on their own, based on information obtained through the media, friends or other sources.  If the participant mentions \"blood thinning\" or avoiding blood clots as the reason for taking aspirin, record \"H.\"  If neither a heart attack or st roke is mentioned, record \"O,\" even if the aspirin was prescri bed by a physician.  With a positive response to the initial Item 32, confirm whether the reported medication(s) is transcribed in section B.  33e. Enter the year and month of  the onset of regular use in  34e.  If the participant is unsure, ask for a best guess.  If an es timate cannot be made, record \"==\" in the appropriate month and year field(s).  If the partici pant can only estimate the year, use 06 for the month.  34. Read Item 34 as written.   Item 34a parallels the as pirin question (Item 32) but documents the current, regular use of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAID).  Item 34 excludes Tylenol and aspirin (as separate entities) and MSR B QxQ_08 112005(1 )  Page 18 of 19 steroids.  N onsteroidal drugs are t he most common non-aspirin treatments of arthritis.  If the partici pant is unsure about a medici ne but mentions its name, quickly check the LIST  OF NON- STEROIDAL ANTI-INFLAMMATORY DRUGS to decide.  No te skip patterns.   If participant ans wers YES, then continue by  reading 34b.  b. If the response to 34b is Ibuprofen or  Advil, record YES (1) and skip to 34d.  If the participant repor ts a different non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug, then code OTHE R and transcribe the name in Item 34c.  c. Do not ask this question; record the name based on the response to Item 34b.  If the preparation is availabl e, use it to verify the respons e.  d. Read the question.  The purpose of this question is to document the average number of NS AID tablets the person takes during a typical week.  'Pills' refers to t ablets.  If >99, record as 99.  If < 1, record as zero.  If \"half tablets\" were used, di vide the number of half tablets by 2 and round fractions up to the next  integer.  For example, record the use of 7 half tablets of Ibuprofen per week as 04.  e. Read Item 34e inserting the brand name of the drug where indicat ed and record the month and year t he participant began taking the drug on a regular basis.  F.  Folk Medicine  This section documents the us e of home remedies or folk  medicines during the last two weeks.  35-41. Read Items 35-41 exactly as worded.  For each affirmative  choice determine and record the number of days the re medy was used during the past two weeks and the purpose for its use.  Record  the purpose verbat im in the space provided.  If additional space is needed, add a note log in the DES.  42. Read Item 42 to all respondents, emphasiz ing ever.  If  Yes, continue on with Items 42b and 42c.  If No, end the interview.  G.

General Instructions   The Stroke Symptoms (SSF) form is completed during the  flexible component of the participant's Exam 2 clinic visit.  The interviewer must be c ertified and should have a working knowledge of the document titled \"General Instructions for Completing Paper Forms\" prior to completing this form.  ID Number, Contact Year, and Name should be completed as described in that document.   II. General Definiti ons  The goal of the SSF is to determine whether the participant has had a health -care provider -diagnosed stroke or symptoms of a stroke  since the time of her/his baseline (Exam 1) JHS clinic visit.  Throughout the questions, the words \"sudden\" and \"sudden ly\" should be taken to mean what the participant perceives those terms to be.  A stroke generally includes one or more of the following symptoms which begin suddenly : (1) loss or change of speech, (2) loss of vision, (3) double vision, (4) numbness or tingl ing on one side of the body, (5) paralysis or weakness on one side of the body, or (6) spells of dizziness or loss of balance.  Therefore, a series of questions are asked for each symptom to determine whether an event took place, its duration, and its loca tion, e.g., right carotid, left carotid or vertebrobasilar.   III. Specific Instructions   For all items, please make sure that the participant understands the time frame for the questions. For each, we want to know if there has been any NEW diagnosis since the t ime of the last JHS examination (Exam1).  Periodically remind the participant of the time frame.   A. New Stroke  1.

GENERAL INSTRUCTIONS   The Medical History (MHX) form is completed during the interview portion of the participant's Exam 2 clinic visit. The interviewer must be certifie d and should have a working knowledge of data entry procedures for electronic version forms and the document titled \"General Instructions for Completing Paper Forms\" prior to completing this form.  ID Number, Contact Year, and Name should be completed as described in that document.     The next three sections have been largely adapted from the London School of Hygiene Cardiova scular Questionnaire.  Section A  deals with chest pain on effort.  Secti on B deals with  severe and prolonged pain of possible myoc ardial infarction, and Section C  deals with intermittent clau dication.  The other sections, D -H of the form, provide information on congestive heart failure, invasive procedures, and diagnostic procedures.   Items on the form enclosed in braces are instructions  to the interviewer, and should not be stated verbally during the interview.    II. SPECIFIC INSTRUCTIONS    A.  Chest Pain on Effort   This item assesses the occurrence of chest pain at any time in the participant s lifetime.   1. If NO, DONT KNOW, REFUSED, OR MISSING,  skip to Item 25 .  Items 1through 7  refer to the usual characteristics of the pain and discomfort.  Unequivocal answers need not be probed; but answers such as occasionally or sometimes should be probed by a question of the type:  Does thi s happen on most occasions?  Skip rules must be adhered to.   2. The answer must be interpreted strictly.  If pain is experienced only during some other form of exertion (e.g. cycling, stair climbing, lawn mowing), it must be recorded as No.\"   3. Record i f the participant has chest pain while walking.  If NO, DONT KNOW, REFUSED, OR MISSING , skip to Item 22 . MHX QxQ   2  4. Record what the participant does if chest pain occurs while walking.  If the participant indicates s/he takes nitroglycerine and continues  record STOP or SLOW DOWN.   5. Record what happens to the chest pain if the participant stands still.  If the pain is NOT RELIEVED, DONT KNOW, REFUSED, OR MISSING , go to Item 22 .  6. Record the time required for relief of chest pain after stopping.   7. Record all  sites the participant shows you the chest pain was located.  Mark YES or NO for each item .  If OTHER  is indicated, proceed to item 8 .  8. Record a ny additional areas from Item 7 .  9. Record if the participant saw a doctor because of the chest pain.   10. Record the doctor's assessment of the pain.   11. Record if the participant has been hospitalized for chest pain.   12. Indicate the shortest applicable time interval, but not one that is less than the actual span of time.  For example, 7 months ago should be recorded as WITHIN THE PAST 1 YEAR .  13 - 21. All questions apply only to the past 2 months  (that is, 60 days prior to the clinic visit) .  Therefore, this phrase is repeated wit h each question (except Items 14 and 17 , for smoothness).   C.  Possible In farction   22 - 29. Ask questions exactly as printed.  Skip rules must be observed for the questions to make sense.   25 - 26. Both questions refer only to heart attacks for which the participant was hospitalized one week or more (as stated in Item 25 ).    28. The question refers to an exercise test; therefore, a resting ECG would not apply.   D.  Intermittent Claudication   30 - 39. Ask questions exactly as they are printed; interpret answers strictly.   32 - 34. These questions refer to the usual characteristi cs of pain or discomfort.  MHX QxQ   3 Unequivocal answers need not be probed, but answers such as occasionally or sometimes should be probed by a question of the type:  Does this happen on most occasions?  Skip rules must be adhered to.   D.  Congestive Heart Fa ilure   40 - 43. These questions are prefac ed by the phrase, Have you had  , thus it is not necessary that the condition be habitual.   42. For female participants only, include the phrase:  excluding during pregnancy.   43. The question refers to the swe lling of feet or a nkles established in question 42.  E.  Invasive Procedures   44 - 48. These questions are intended to assess whether or not the participant has had any invasive procedures such as surgery on the heart or arteries of the neck or legs; ballo on angioplasty on the arteries of the heart, neck or legs; and/or cathe terizations of the heart or other arteries.    For Item 48 a-c, if the answer is YES, proceed to determine the reason that the participant had the procedure. These procedures are particul arly important in helping to establish a possible cardiac event and, if the participant was not hospitalized overnight, will not be captured in hospital medical records review. Therefore it is important to try and identify the reason for which the particip ant had the procedure.    A list of possible reasons is identified for each type of procedure. If none of the identified reasons are provided by the participant, code the response as OTHER and SPECIFY the reason given by the participant. If s/he does not know why the procedure was done, record DONT KNOW.   G.  Diagnostic Procedures   49. This question is intended to assess whether or not the participant has ever had any of the following procedures:  echocardiogram, electrocardiogram, treadmill or cardiac str ess test, or MRI exam of the brain performed for medical reasons.  If procedures were done for research studies or a fitness program, code answers as NO.  For Item 49 a-d, if the answer is YES, proceed to determine the reason that the participant had the pr ocedure. These procedures are particularly important in helping to establish a possible cardiac event and, if the participant was not hospitalized overnight, will not be captured in hospital MHX QxQ   4 medical records review. Therefore it is important to try and iden tify the reason for which the participant had the procedure.    A list of possible reasons is identified for each type of procedure. If none of the identified reasons are provided by the participant, code the response as OTHER and SPECIFY the reason given b y the participant. If s/he does not know why the procedure was done, record DONT KNOW.    G.   Administrative Information   50. Enter the date on which the participant was seen in the clinic.   51. Record  1 if this form was completed on the computerized d ata entry system, or  2 if the paper form was used.  If the form was completed partially on the computer, code as PAPER FORM   52.   Record 1 if this form was completed in the clinic and 2 if completed during home visit.   53. Enter the 3 digit JHS inte rviewer ID of the person completing this form in the boxes provided."

GENERAL INSTRUCTIONS   The Medication Survey (MSR) form is completed during the participant s Exam 2  clinic exam visit.  The purpose of the MSR is to assess medicat ion usage in the two weeks  preceding the examination date.  Information on both prescription and non -prescription drugs and herbals is ascertained.  To obtain this information, the participant is asked prior to the clinic visit to bring all medications tak en in the two -week period preceding the Exam 2 visit to the Exam Center . Instructions and a bag for that purpose is mailed to the participant   Interviewers require certification in interviewing techniques and familiarity with the data entry procedures for paper and electronic versions of the form (references:  Data Entry System manual and the \"General Instructions for Completing Paper Forms\"). Transcribers and coders of medication information also require certification. Whenever a transcriber has any diffic ulty in transcribing a medication, s/he is to consult with the Clinic Manager to clarify the problem before proceeding.  Header information (ID Number, Contact Year, and Name) are completed in the format described in that document.    II. SPECIFIC INSTRUCTIO NS  A.  Reception   1. Have you taken any medications in the past 2 weeks? This includes  Any prescription medications, all over the counter medications, all vitamins, minerals, herbs, and dietary supplements.            Yes  1             No  2            Dont Know  7            Refused  8            Missing  9  If the response is NO, REFUSED, or MISSING, Section A ends here. Leave Section B (MEDICATION RECORDS) blank and skip  to MEDICATION TAKING BEHAVIORS, Section D.  If the response is DONT KNOW, continue o n to 3a to attempt to follow up with them Go to 3a   Go to 30 a   Go to 3a  MSR QxQ   Page 2 of 19 after the clinic visit to obtain information on potential medications taken in the last 2 weeks.     2. Did you bring all the medications you used in the past two weeks, or their containers?             Yes, all   1    Some of them  2          None (Forgot/Unable)  3           Dont Know   7           Refused   8           Missing   9  If the response is YES ALL  go to Section B (MEDICATION TRANSCRIPTION) and begin the transcription.  This can take place at the reception  station or while the participant proceeds with the clinic visit.  As the participant delivers the medications, indicate where (and by whom) they will be returned before s/he leaves.  Mention that medication names will be copied from the labels, and that i f required, medications will be taken out of their container only in the presence of, and with approval of, the participant.  Finally, indicate that a trained interviewer will later ask a few questions about each medication.  Verify that the medications ba g is clearly identified with the participant's name.  Do not open the medications bag or transcribe medications until the participant has signed the informed consent.   If the response is SOME OF THEM,  go to Item 3 a to make arrangements with the participant  to obtain the information for those medications which were not brought; transcribe those medications which were brought in Section B (MEDICATION TRANSCRIPTION).  The preferred arrangement is follow up with the participant by telephone on the day of the cl inic visit .  If that is not possible, arrangements should be made to follow up with the participant by telephone  on another date .  If the response is NONE (FORGOT/UNABLE TO BRING MEDICATIONS), reassure the respondent with the statement Thats alright.  Si nce the information on medications is so important, we would still like to ask you about it during the interview.  C larify that they did indeed take medications in the past two weeks and go to Item 3a to make arrangements to obtain the information for tho se medications which were not brought.   Go to Section B and begin transcription while participant proceeds with clinic visit.  Go to Item 3a to determine follow up opt ions for medications they did not bring.   Go to Item 4 and transcribe those medications which were brought at this time.  . MSR QxQ   Page 3 of 19  3a. Could we follow up on this after the visit so that we can get the information   from the (other) medication labels?  [Explain follow -up options].       Yes     1      No (Dont want follow up)   2      Want to list  by memory   3      Dont know     7      Refused     8      Missing     9  [Attempt to convert refusals; indicate on Participant Itinerary Form (PIN)].   3 b. Describe method of follow -up to be used:_____________________________________________________________ __  If the participant agrees to follow -up, make arrangements for obtaining the information either by the participant returning to clinic with her/his medication containers  or over the telephone.  Describe the method of follow -up after Item 3 on the form.  If the participant brought some medications, complete as much of Section B (MEDICATION TRANSCRIPTION) as possible.   In case of deliberate omission to bring medications to the Exam Center, the interviewer attempts participant conversion at the reception or  a subsequent workstation.  If participant conversion is to be attempted after reception, write a note to that effect on the Itinerary Sheet.  Leave Section B (MEDICATION TRANSCRIPTION) items 4A  26B blank if no medications were brought in.  Even if the p articipant declines to bring in (or provide medication names during telephone follow up ), attempt to complete as much of Section C, D, and E as possible.  If the participant has not brought her/his medications, but remembers the names and concentration (st rength) of all medications taken during the previous two weeks with confidence, the interviewer can make the judgment to record this information without a follow -up during the 24 -hour sample pick up or via phone call.  Circle WANT TO LIST BY MEMORY and proceed to Section  B (MEDICATION TRANSCRIPTION).   If the participant is unsure about follow up, circle DONT KNOW and attempt to get permission for a follow up telephone contact. If participant declines to answer the question, circle REFUSED, and if the data i s legitimately missing, circle MISSING.   MSR QxQ   Page 4 of 19 B.  Medications Transcription   Section B (MEDICATION TRANSCRIPTION) is divided into three components to document information about each medication used by the participant: (1) Transcription, (2) Interview, and (3) M edication Coding.  Transcription includes recording in column (a) the medication name, in column (b) concentration (strength), and in column (c) the instructions for administration of each medication used within the two weeks prior to the interview.  The i nterview portion consists of determining and recording in column (d) whether the medication was taken within the last 24 hours  and (e) why the patient is taking the medication (e.g. for blood pressure, sugar, arthritis, etc) .  Medication Codes are coded us ing the DMS version of the MEDISPAN Medication Dictionary and recorded in column ( f) (this column is not included on paper version of form) .  The transcription of the medication name (column a), concentration (column b), and instructions for administration  (column c) is done by a trained transcriptionist prior to the interview with the participant or by an interviewer in conjunction with the administration of the questions in column (d).  The coding of the medications from the DMS medication dictionary is d one later by a trained coder after the interview is completed.   Begin this process by opening the medications bag and removing all medications.  In column (a), transcribe the medication name (in BLOCK LETTERS if using a paper form), followed by the concent ration in column (b), and instructions for administration in column (c), beginning with Item 4.  Include all parts of the medication name and any numbers and/or letters that identify the strength (concentration).  For keying purposes, the following format should be used when transcribing the medication name and concentration.  For example:   Column (a)      Column (b)  AMPICILLIN      250 mg  AMPICILLIN LIQUID    125mg/5ml  NOSTRIL      1/2 %  ANACIN MAXIMUM STRENGTH   =====   Also copy any numbers and codes which fol low or are part of the name.  For example:    ANACIN -3    STUARTNATAL 1 + 1   ACEROLA C (100 MG)   ILETIN I NPH   TRIAMINIC12    S-K AMPICILLIN   OVRAL28     CALTRATE 600 + VITAMIN D   ORTHO -NOVUM 10/11 -28  If in doubt, it is preferable to add information that may  be insignificant.  This will help later in identifying (and coding) a medication.   To facilitate the recording process some standard abbreviations have been established.

Do not use ditto marks (\") to indicate a repeat of a previous item.   Sometimes the drug name includes numbers or letters which could be mistaken for dosage.  Having these numbers or letters as part of the drug name helps in selecting MSR QxQ   Page 7 of 19 the appropriate code.  Therefore, it is better to record all the information related to medication name and concentration on the form in a standard format.  The following guidelines are offered for standardization.   Medication Transcription     * Print complete names using block capital letters.     * Record all ident ifying characters and numbers referring to concentration.   * Record instructions for administration completely as written on the labels using standardized abbreviations if desired.     * Include as much identifying information as possible.   Sometimes the do sage form may appear to be part of the drug name since a few companies have trademarks for their dosage forms.  For example, Enseals for enteric coated tablets and Kapseals or Pulvules for capsules.  You may record these names as identifying information.   Combination Drugs   Combination medicines contain two or more drugs in a single pill or tablet.  Some combination medicines such as Dyazide come in only one fixed combination (hydrochlorothiazide 25 mg and triamterene 50 mg); these combination medicines do not generally list the strength.  Record DYAZIDE, in the space medication name and do not record anything for concentration.   Other combination medicines such as Inderide are available in more than one fixed dose combination (propranolol 40 mg and hydrochl orothiazide 25 mg; or propranolol 80 mg and hydrochlorothiazide 25 mg); these combination medicines generally list the strength as in \"Inderide 40/25\" or \"Inderide 80/25.\"  For these medicines, record, for example, INDERIDE, in the space for name, and \"40/ 25\" or \"80/25\" after the name as the concentration.  For example:   Drugs containing two or more medications:    Example of fixed dosage:    Dyazide (hydrochlorothiazide and triamterene) code \"DYAZIDE\"    Examples of variable dosage:  Inderide 40/25 (40 mg Inde ral, 25 mg hydrochlorothiazide) code \"INDERIDE 40/25\"   Inderide 80/25 (80 mg Inderal, 25 mg hydrochlorothiazide) code \"INDERIDE 80/25\"  MSR QxQ   Page 8 of 19  * Do not record flavors of products and whether the preparations are sugar -free or sodium -free.  Concentration   Most dru g concentrations are given in grams, milligrams or micrograms.  Record as written on  the label using the abbreviations \"gm\" for grams, \"mg\" for milligrams and \"mcg\" for micrograms.  Rarely the dosage may be given in grains.  Use the abbreviation \"gr\" for t his.  When strength is not recorded as milligrams (mg) record all numbers, digits and characters used to denote concentration; this includes:   .  -  decimal point    gm  =  gram(s)  ml  -  milliliter     gr    =  grain(s)  /ml  -  per milliliter     mg  =  mil ligram  mEq  -  milliequivalents    mcg =  microgram  hr  -  hour /hr  -  per hour  %  - percent   Note: When the abbreviation, \"PC\" (percent) is used, record percent symbol, \"%.\"   SPECIFICS:   * Record strength of combination drugs where strength is separated by a \"/\" here.   * Liquid medicine concentration is often written in mg/ml (milligrams per milliliter).  For example, Ampicillin 125 mg /5 ml, is recorded as: \"AMPICILLIN for name and 125 mg/5ml\" for concentration.   * Concentration for some medicines may be written as a percentage.  For example: Alupent 0.6%, is recorded as:   \"ALUPENT for name and 0.6%\" for concentration   * Concentration for insulin is generally \"U100\" or 100 units per milliliter.\"  This is often written as \"100/ml\" or \"100U/ml.\"  Record  Insulin concentration as \"U100\" unless another strength is listed on the label.   NOTE:  Do not record the quantity or number of pills/tablets dispensed.   If more than 26 medications are present or reported by the participant, only 26 medications are coded  and keyed, selected according to the priorities described below. If it is necessary to defer the assignation of priorities for medications to be transcribed, the name and strength of each additional medication is recorded on the MSR QxQ   Page 9 of 19 back of page 3 of the pape r form, until 26 medication names are selected for transcription and coding.  Medications may be prioritized during transcription by combining the transcription and interview components.   Prioritization is performed only if there are more than 26 medicatio ns and is based on the following algorithm: prescription medications first; then aspirin, aspirin -containing medications and anti -inflammatory preparations (aspirin, Alka -Seltzer, headache powders, cold medicine, medication for arthritis); followed by othe r over -the-counter preparations; then vitamins and food supplements and any other medications last.

If necessa ry, make a note on the form, and let the participant know that a trained interviewer will identify these medications with her/him.  Enter your JHS technician/interviewer code number in Item 28a (Transcriber code number).  The code number of the person codi ng the medication is entered in Item 28b.  The date on which the medications are coded is entered in Item 29c.  Return the medications to the carrier bag.  If the interview portion has not been administered, place the MSR paper form (if appropriate) in the  medication bag and take the medication bag to a secure location for use at the workstation in which the interview will be administered.  If the interview portion of the form has been administered, take the bag to a secure place for returning to the partic ipant at the medical data review workstation.  AT NO TIME SHOULD THE MEDICATIONS BE LEFT UNATTENDED AND UNSECURED.   Once all names are transcribed, count the total number of different medications that the participant brought to the clinic and enter this nu mber in Item 27. Count the actual medications to determine thee total. Do not refer to the record numbers on the screen or paper form.   Column (d).  USE IN PAST 24 HOURS   After the transcription of the medication name, concentration, and instructions for administration, or the verification of the accuracy of the transcription and its use within the last 2 weeks, the interviewer ascertains the use of each medication within the past 24 hours, while showing the participant each separate container .  The followi ng question is asked for each medication:    d. \"Did you take this medication in the last 24 hours?\"   If probing is required to assist the participant in remembering, the question  may be  repeated , specifying a time on the previous day.

Determine from Item 28 on the form at the end of Section B whether there are any medications in the bag for which the receptionist was unable to transcribe the name/concentration.  These may include unmarked containers, loose pills, and containers with more than one medication.  Ask the participant to open any unmarked containers, and to handle loose pills.  With the participant's help and using a Physicians Desk Reference (PDR), attempt to identify these medications.  If possible, enter the name and concentration, and ask if the medication was taken in the last 24 hours.  If the medication cannot be identifi ed, write UNKNOWN for the medication name and draw two horizontal lines through the boxes (enter \"=\" in the spaces) for the medication code number.  If additional medications can be transcribed, adjust the total for Item 28. \"Number of medications unable t o transcribe:\", accordingly.  After this has been completed for all containers, prescriptions and medications in the bag, probe the participant on whether all medications taken in the previous two weeks are included.  For any additional medications recalle d by the participant, record the names and answer the questions with as much detail as possible.  If there is any doubt, arrange for a review during the 24 -hour pick up or phone call during which the participant can provide accurate information.   During th e rest of the Medication Survey interview or during a subsequent interview, the participant may recall other medications or vitamins taken during the past two weeks.  Their name, concentrations, and instructions for administration, are transcribed in colum ns (a), (b), and (c), respectively, and last ingestion (use) is recorded in column (d) at this time, just as if they had been in the medication bag.  However, the number of medications in the bag is not changed . This documents that information on some medi cations were provided from the participant's memory.   Column E. Reason for Taking Medication   Record verbatim t he reason that the participant gives for taking this medication. If s/he does not know, record DONT KNOW. Or if s/he refuses to respond, record REFUSED. If the item is legitimately missing, record MISSING.    Column (f). CODE NUMBER. (NOT VISIBLE ON PAPER FORM)   The 14 -digit medication code numbers are found in the DES version of the Medication Dictionary which has been distributed to the Exam Cent er.  The drug MSR QxQ   Page 13 of 19 names are listed in alphabetical order.  Drug names that begin with a number, ditto (\"), or a dash ( -) are listed first.  If a drug name is separated by a hyphen, the portion of the name preceding the hyphen is listed in alphabetical order.   If you encounter a drug name which is not in the dictionary, do not guess at a match.  Simply set the status code to Q (questionable) so that the pharmacist at the Coordinating Center can develop a code number and update the dictionary.   Numbers that appea r in the dictionary are used to differentiate between products.  Before coding a drug entry, determine whether the numbers which are recorded are part of the name or are strength/concentration information.  Numbers referring to strength/concentration are n ot used in the matching process for medication coding.   Some drug products use a suffix to distinguish between combination products containing the same primary drug.  For example:     Darvon = propoxyphene hydrochloride    Darvon N = propoxyphene napsylate    Darvon Cmpd = propoxyphene hydrochloride with aspirin and caffeine    Darvon with ASA = propoxyphene hydrochloride and aspirin   When coding a medication which contains more than one word, look for a match of the entire name in the dictionary.  If the name matches, enter the corresponding code.  If a complete match cannot be found, but the dictionary has a single entry for the ingredient(s) in the medication (usually the first word of the drug name), and there are no other entries containing this word , selec t the corresponding code.  This occurs most often when:   both the brand and generic name are transcribed, but only one is given in the dictionary;   the form of the drug is transcribed, but not given in the dictionary;   the seller's name is transcribed, but is  not listed in the dictionary.   It is critical that the other words in the transcribed drug name do NOT involve additional ingredients.    Examples:  CORDARONE/AMIODARONE  not in the dictionary; code as AMIODARONE, which is listed.   DIMETAPP ELIXIR  not in the  dictionary; code as DIMETAPP, which is listed.     ECKERD ALLERGY   not in the dictionary; code    RELIEF TABS    as ALLERGY RELIEF,  MSR QxQ   Page 14 of 19        which is listed.   TYLENOL NO. 3  not in the dictionary; cannot code, since \"NO.3\" could designate another ingredient; in  fact, it designates codeine. It can be coded by searching for the abbreviation of Tylenol's ingredient with codeine: APAP W CODEINE, which is in the dictionary.   In order to put drug names on the prescription label, pharmacists may use abbreviations.  Unf ortunately, these abbreviations are often not standardized.  Some frequently used abbreviations, however, occur in the Medication Dictionary.  For example:    APAP  =  acetaminophen    HC =  hydrocortisone   ASA =  aspirin     HCI =  hydrochloride   CAFF  =  caff eine    HCTZ  =  hydrochlorothiazide   Cl =  chloride     IV =  intravenous   CMP  =  compound     K =  potassium   COD  =  codeine     M =  minerals   DM =  dextromethorphan   SR =  sustained release   Fl =  fluoride     T =  therapeutic   GG =  glyceralguiacolate   XR =  extended release   C.  Interview   This portion of the Medication Survey is administered by the nurse -clinician or a trained interviewer.   For Item 30, ask if medications were taken in the past two weeks for the nine listed reasons.   The following synony ms may be given in response to participant questions.   a. High blood pressure = hypertension  c. Angina or chest pain = heart pains  d. Control of heart rhythm = medicine for fast or irregular heart rate or heart beats  e. Heart failure  = congestive heart fai lure, not heart attack  f. Blood thinning = anticoagulation  i. Leg pain when walking = claudication   NOTE:  Stroke does not  include TIA nor \"slight strokes\" which lasted less than 24 hours.   MSR QxQ   Page 15 of 19 For example, if the participant had taken medication for high bloo d pressure and claudication and no other listed conditions, Item 29 would be coded as follows:    29. Were any of the medications you took during the past two weeks for:        [If \"Yes,\" verify that medication name is on medication record.]                Dont          Yes No Know    a.

Leg pain when walking      Y N D   If any of the conditions are answered affirmatively, be sure that the medication is recorded in Section B.  The interviewer, however, can not  ask the part icipant to identify which medication was used to treat any of the conditions.  For example, if the participant reported taking a medication to lower blood pressure during the last two weeks (Item 29.a), and no recognizable antihypertensive medications were  recorded in Section B  and the participant did not give blood pressure as a reason for taking any of the medications transcribed from her/his medication bag , the interviewer may probe to determine if the names of all medications taken during the last two w eeks were recorded.  If the person indicates that the names of all her/his medications have been transcribed, the interviewer can not probe further to determine which medication was used to treat the high blood pressure.  The interviewer can however say som ething similar to: You did not mention that any of your medication bottles were a medicine for blood pressure. Was that an oversight or is it possible that you left that medication at home? If they left the medication at home, go back to Item 2 and 3 to indicate that not all medications Comment [SW1]: Brenda please update this to include the refused andmissing codes, and to change all t he letters to numbers. Thanks.  MSR QxQ   Page 16 of 19 were brought, and determine a time for follow up.   D. Medication Taking Behaviors   This section is obtains information on the participants usual medication -taking behaviors, or taking medications as prescribed.   Item 30 is asked of all participants regardless of whether they reported taking any medication during the past two weeks or whether they brought day medication to the Exam Center.  This question is asked as worded.  Explanation about memory jogging or thinking o f times when they have taken prescription medications in the past may be offered at the beginning of this question.  Read each item in the list and indicate whether the item was indicated or not as a reason for taking medications exactly as prescribed.   For example, if the participant had indicated they had not taken medications according to directions by reason of not liking to take medicines and that it made them feel bad, Item 30 would be coded as follows:  MSR QxQ   Page 17 of 19           Reason   Not a   Dont         Indicate d Reason   Know   a.  You were in a hurry, too busy, or forgot       Y   N  D  b.  It was inconvenient, for example, the medication       needed to be refrigerated, or had to be taken with food.   Y   N  D  c.  You thought the medication wouldnt do y ou any good..    Y   N  D  d.  The medication made you feel bad   Y   N  D  e.  If you took the medication, you wouldnt be able to       carry out your normal activities for example, driving   Y   N  D  f.  You thought you might become addicted o r hooked on       the medication   Y   N  D  g.  You dont like to take medicines.   Y   N  D  h.  You were trying to do without it     Y   N  D  i.  You did not have money to purchase the medication       (or its refi lls)      Y   N  D  j.  Did not have the medication available.      Y   N  D  k.  Are there any other reasons why you havent taken a       prescribed medication?Y   N  D  l.  If yes, specify reason:      E.  Aspirin and NSAID Use   31. Although the primary purpose of Item 31 is to identify participants who are taking aspirin, the question is broadly constructed to include aspirin and other medications which may contain aspirin but are not necessarily labeled as aspirin , such as \"Alka -Seltzer, cold medicine or headache powder.\"  Therefore, this question may identify persons taking medications which do not include aspirin.   32. Read the transition statement and Item 32 to all participants who responded YES to Item 32.  We are after the current use (NOW) of aspirin or aspirin containing medication on a REGULAR basis, regardless of the reason for its use.  These medications do not include Tylenol, Advil, etc.  Consult the list of Aspirin or Aspirin Containing Medications at  the end of these instructions if in Comment [SW2]: Brenda update this to include the Refused and Missing codes and change the letters to numbers.  MSR QxQ   Page 18 of 19 doubt.  If asked by the participant, \"regular\" is defined as at least once a week for several months.  If the response is \" NO or UNKONWN  skip to Item 34.  When the response is Yes, continue by asking Item 33a.  33a. Read the question and select the appropriate letter from the four response codes.  Strength refers to the number of milligrams of aspirin per pill, not the total number of milligrams taken.  (Buffered aspirin does not refer to strength, but to added ingredien ts.)  The participant may offer the actual milligrams, which can be categorized as shown in the responses.  If the person can recall that the strength of the pill was not baby, but can not distinguish between regular and extra strength, code as regular, 'B .'  If the participant does not remember at all, record DONT KNOW.   33b. Read the question.  The purpose of this question is to document the number of days per week aspirin is taken .  Record the typical frequency (i.e., \"on average\") of the aspirin that i s used on a regular basis.  If less than one day per week, record as zero.  Round half days up to the next integer.  The maximum number of days per week is 7.   33c. Read the question.  In contrast to part (b), the purpose of this question is to document th e average number of aspirin tablets the person takes during a typical week.  'Pills' refers to both aspirin and aspirin containing medications, either in tablet or powder form.  If >99, record as 99.  If < 1, record as zero.  If \"half tablets\" were used, d ivide the number of half tablets by 2 and round fractions up to the next integer.  For example, record the use of 7 half tablets of aspirin per week as 04.   33d. Read the question.  Do not read the choices.  If the participant mentions avoiding heart attac k or stroke as part of her/his response, record \"H.\"  Individuals could be following the advice of their provider of medical care in doing this, or they could be acting on their own, based on information obtained through the media, friends or other sources .  If the participant mentions \"blood thinning\" or avoiding blood clots as the reason for taking aspirin, record \"H.\"  If neither a heart attack or stroke is mentioned, record \"O,\" even if the aspirin was prescribed by a physician.  With a positive respons e to the initial Item 32, confirm whether the reported medication(s) is transcribed in section B.   33e. Enter the year and month of the onset of regular use in 34e.  If the participant is unsure, ask for a best guess.  If an estimate cannot be made, record  \"==\" in the appropriate month and year field(s).  If the participant can only estimate the year, use 06 for the month.   34. Read Item 34 as written.  Item 34a parallels the aspirin question (Item 32) but documents the current, regular use of nonsteroida l anti -inflammatory drugs (NSAID).  Item 34 excludes Tylenol and aspirin (as separate entities) and MSR QxQ   Page 19 of 19 steroids.  Nonsteroidal drugs are the most common non -aspirin treatments of arthritis.  If the participant is unsure about a medicine but mentions its name,  quickly check the LIST OF NON -STEROIDAL ANTI -INFLAMMATORY DRUGS to decide.  Note skip patterns.  If participant answers YES, then continue by reading 34b.  b. If the response to 34b is Ibuprofen or Advil, record YES (1)  and skip to 34d.  If the particip ant reports a different non -steroidal anti -inflammatory drug, then code OTHER  and transcribe the name in Item 34c.  c. Do not ask this question; record the name based on the response to Item 34b.  If the preparation is available, use it to verify the respo nse.  d. Read the question.  The purpose of this question is to document the average number of NSAID tablets the person takes during a typical week.  'Pills' refers to tablets.  If >99, record as 99.  If < 1, record as zero.  If \"half tablets\" were used, d ivide the number of half tablets by 2 and round fractions up to the next integer.  For example, record the use of 7 half tablets of Ibuprofen per week as 04.   e. Read Item 34e inserting the brand name of the drug where indicated and record the month and ye ar the participant began taking the drug on a regular basis.   F.  Folk Medicine   This section documents the use of home remedies or folk medicines during the last two weeks.   35-41. Read Items 35-41 exactly as worded.  For each affirmative choice determine  and record the number of days the remedy was used during the past two weeks and the purpose for its use.  Record the purpose verbatim in the space provided.  If additional space is needed, add a note log in the DES.   42. Read Item 42 to all respondents, e mphasizing ever.  If  Yes, continue on with Items 42b and 42c.  If No, end the interview.   G.  ADMINISTRATIVE INFORMATION   43. Enter the date of data collection.   44. Enter the method of data collection by PAPER  or COMPUTER   45. Enter the 3 -digit JHS intervi ewer ID of the person completing this form."

We want to know how much time they usually  spend watching television on a daily or weekly basis .  The item 5 should not include time when the television was on but the participant was doing other activities and not watching. If necessar y, ask the participant  to tell you the averag e amount during the past year, or pick the response that seems best. Do not cho ose the response for a participant .   B. Occupational Activities   Items 6 to 9e refer to work activity, for pay or volunteer work.   The responses do not refer to work around the house.   Record one answer per question.   6. Read item 6.  If the participant did not work for pay or do volunteer work during the past year, go to the Home, Family, Yard, and Garden section and omit questions 7 throu gh 9e.   7. Item 7 asks participants to compare themselves to others of similar age and gender. Show response card 4  (RC#4) .  8. Item 8 r efers to how physically  tired the participant feels after work. Show response card 5  (RC#5) .  9. Items 9a through 9e :  Show RC#5) .  For 9e, note that this question asks about sweating as a result of work effort , not  because the temperature is hot .  Emphasize the word exertion when reading Item 9e.    C. Home , Family, Yard, and Garden   This section inquires about how often certain acti vities are performed around the home.    Some of the activities described in this section could  be done for pay or as volunteer work .  However, we want to separate out the activity that is done for pay from activity at home not for pay in the PAC survey .  In this section, we only want activity that is not for pay and is not done as volunteer work.   These activities are familiar to everyone and asking about them can help parti cipants feel you appreciate the kind of activities they do every day.  Record only one answer for each item.   10. Read item 10 and s how response card 6.    3 11. Read item 11 and Show response card 7.  This item refers only to the time spent preparing the food, not the time that the food was cooking without any activity by the preparer.   12. Read item 1 2 and s how response card 2.   13. Read item 13 and s how response card 2.   14. Read item 14 and s how response card 2.  Some of these activities are seasonal so participant s may mention they do  a lot during part of the year and less in ot her times of the year.  Ask participant s to choose the response that best describes their typica l activity.  Do not choose response s for them.   15. Read item 15 and s how response card 2.   16. Read item 16 and s how response card 2.   D. Sports and Exercise   The last section inquires about partic ipation in specific sport and exercise activities.  Many respondents will indicate they did not participate in any of the activities.  Show participa nts the SPORTS AND EXERCISE LIST  to help them think about all the possible activities that we want to know about.  They can also report sports and exercise not on the list (these will be entered in by the interviewer.) Participants who answer yes will then be asked to report up to 3 activities, in order of frequency, and to indicate how many months and how ma ny hours of participation. Record only one answer per item.   17. Read item 17 and s how the participant the SPORTS AND EXERCISE LIST.   Participants should respond yes if they did any activities on the list or similar activities for sports and exercise during the past year.  The activity does not have to be on the list.   If the response to item 17 is No, then go to item 28.    18.  Read item 18.  Show response card 8 (RC#8).   The purpose of this item is to find out generally how often participants engaged in some kind of sports or exercise.  This could be different kinds of exercise at different times of the year.  A participant who walked for exercise every Sunday throughout the year except for a few times but didnt do any other exercise should choose response 4.   A participant who played basketball in the winter about three times a month and then played tennis during the other seasons of the year at least 1 or 2 times a week should choose response 4 or 5, depending on how much of the time he or she played tennis.   19.  Read item 19a.  Show the participant  the SPORTS AND EXERCISE LIST to learn about the most frequent type of exercise or sports during the past year. When participants report an activity from the list, write the number code for that  4 activity as the respon se at 19b.  Encourage participants to choose an activity from the list if it is similar to their activity.  ( If you are familiar with an activity and are confident it is another name for one of the activities on the list, you may substitute the coded activ ity.  Examples: if participants  work out with Cybex rather than Nautilus machines, choose code 14.   If participants report playing squash, substitute code 19 for racquetball. ) When participants report an activity that is not on the list, describe the activ ity at 19c so that experts can later code it.   20. Read item 20 and show response card 9.  This item refers to the months in the past year when the participant engaged in the activity recorded above.  The answer to this item could be confusing to a person who j ust started doing an activity recently.  In this case, the interviewer should try to estimate how much of the year the person would have done this activity if they had been doing it all year. For example, if s/he started lifting weights 4 months ago and di d it for 3 of the 4 months, estimate  of a year or 9 months.   21.  Read item 21 and show response card 10.  This item requests the usual number of hours a week the participant engaged in the activity during the months when he or she was doing it during the pa st year.  The time should not include rest time.  If the reported hours seem excessive, repeat it to the participant to be certain.  If the participant says he or she performed the activity for more hours a week during some seasons of the year, record an av erage.  For example, If a participant swims 1 hour a week during June, July, and August but not at all during the rest of the year, record one hour as the response for this item, the response to item 20 is 2 and the response to item 21 is 2.   22.  Read ite m 22 and show the SPORTS AND EXERCISE LIST again. This item is to record the second most frequent type of activity during the past year. Use 22a to indicate if the activity is on the list.   Use 22b to write in the code for the activity.  Use 22c if the act ivity is not included in the list of codes.   23. Read item 23 and show response card 9.  This item refers to the months in the past year when the participant engage d in the activity recorded in item 22 .   24. Read item 24 and show response card 10.  This item requ ests the usual number of hours a week the participant engaged in the activity recorded in item 22.   25. Read item 25 and show the SPORTS AND EXERCISE LIST AGAIN.  This item is to record the third most frequent type of activity during the past year. Use 25a to indicate if the activity is on the list.  Use 22b to write in the code for the activity.  Use 25c if the activity is not included in the list of codes.   26. Read item 26 and show response card 9.  This item refers to the months in the past year when the partic ipant engaged in the activity recorded in item 25 .    5 27. Read item 27 and show response card 10.

GENERAL INSTRUCTIONS   The Personal Data and Socioeconomic (PDS) form is the final data collection component of the Home Induction Interview and is perhaps the most sensitive component of this interview. The PDS collects information on participant and formal occupation, education, income and wealth as well as perceived status.  The placement of these items at the end of the interview is because sig nificant rapport will hopefully have been established between the participant and the interviewer by this point in the interview process. The exact wording and order should be followed to assure standardization.  The interviewer must be certified and have working knowledge of the document titled General Instructions for completing Paper Forms prior to completing this form.  ID, Contact Year and Name are completed as described in that document.  Initiate the form by reading the script at the beginning of the form as printed.

Measure right arm circumference once according to the directions  in Manual 3: Blood Pressu re, and r ecord to the nearest centimeter.  9. Cuff size is determined by arm cir cumference measurement in Item 8 .  The appropriate size for a given arm circumference is given below, and also appears on the form itself.   Arm Circumference   Cuff Size  under 24  cm   Pediatric  24-32 cm    Regular Arm  33-41 cm    Large Arm  over 41 cm    Thigh   10. Instruct the participant to sit quietly, without changing her/his posture, while keeping both feet flat on the floor for five minutes while you step out  of the room. Start a timer, and return promptly after 5 minutes have elapsed .  After the participant has sat quietly for five minutes, measure the heart rate for 30 seconds ( do not count for 15 seconds and multiply by two ) and record the number in the spaces available.  11. After recording the heart rate, enter the time  using the 24 hour clock. For example, if the time is 8:30 am, record 0830 in the blocks provided .  A five -minute wait with no change of posture must precede the first blood pressure measurement.  . D. Omron Cali bration   12. The Omron monitor is set to AUTO  and the unit automatically inflates to the optimal pressure according to each patients blood pressure. Record the maximum inflation level reached by the monitor.    E. First Omron Blood Pressure Measurement   13-14. Measure and record systolic and diastolic blood pressures as described in Manual 3: Blood Pressure.  Right justify, using leading zeros if necessary.   15. Enter the heart rate   F. Second Omron Blood Pressure Measurement   16-17. Measure and record syst olic and diastolic blood pressures as described in Manual 3: Blood Pressure. Right justify, using leading zeros if necessary.   G. Calculated Average Omron Blood Pressure Measurement  19-20. Average systolic (Item 1 9) and diastolic (Item 20) blood pressures are calculated automatically when the form is entered on the computer.   SBP B QxQ (08/27/2005)   Page 3 of 3 21. Enter the average heart rate (automatic calculated).    H. Administrative Information   22. Enter the date on which the participant was seen in the clinic.  Code in numbers using leading zeros where necessary to fill in all boxes.

General Instructions   The Stroke Symptoms (SSF) form is completed during the  flexible component of the participant's Exam 2 clinic visit.  The interviewer must be ce rtified and should have a working knowledge of the document titled \"General Instructions for Completing Paper Forms\" prior to completing this form.  ID Number, Contact Year, and Name should be completed as described in that document.   II. General Definitio ns  The goal of the SSF is to determine whether the participant has had a health -care provider -diagnosed stroke or symptoms of a stroke  since the time of her/his baseline (Exam 1) JHS clinic visit.  Throughout the questions, the words \"sudden\" and \"suddenl y\" should be taken to mean what the participant perceives those terms to be.  A stroke generally includes one or more of the following symptoms which begin suddenly : (1) loss or change of speech, (2) loss of vision, (3) double vision, (4) numbness or tingli ng on one side of the body, (5) paralysis or weakness on one side of the body, or (6) spells of dizziness or loss of balance.  Therefore, a series of questions are asked for each symptom to determine whether an event took place, its duration, and its locat ion, e.g., right carotid, left carotid or vertebrobasilar.   III. Specific Instructions   For all items, please make sure that the participant understands the time frame for the questions. For each, we want to know if there has been any NEW diagnosis since the ti me of the last JHS examination (Exam1).  Periodically remind the participant of the time frame.   A. New Stroke  1.

            "Q": "Health Practices: Tobacco Use Form Instructions  TOB Version B , 02/24/2009 QxQ Date 02/2 4/2009  I. GENERAL INSTRUCTIONS  The Health Practices: Tobacco  Use Form (TOB) is completed during the clinic visit and collects data regarding all forms of tobacco use ove r the participants lifetime. The interviewer must be certified and s/he should be familiar with and understand the document entitled \"General Instructions for Completing Paper Forms\" prior to completing this form. ID, Contact Year and Name are completed a s described in the document.  Initiate the form by reading the script at the be ginning of the form as printed.   II. SPECIFIC INSTRUCTIONS  1. ASK THE QUESTION AS WRITTEN TO EVERY PARTICIPANT.  Record the number of hours per week in which the participant reports s/he was in close contact with people who were smoking. If the participant is unsure, give examples such as in the home, in a car at work, or other close quarters in which people were smoking, such as restaurants or bars, bowling allies, or at a friends home.  2. This question item assesses if the participant  started using tobacco products since his/her first Jackson Heart Study visit.  If the y answer  Yes then continue, and if  No skip to Question 29 in Section B of the questionnaire.  3. This item assesses c igarette smoking over the participants lifetime.  If necessary, inform the participant that 400 cigarettes are equal to 20 packs of cigarettes or 2 cartons of cigarettes. If participant has smoked 400 cigarettes or more record YES.\"  If participant has smo ked less than 400 cigarettes in her/his lifetime, record NO and proceed to Item 16 . If participant is not sure how many cigarettes he/she has smoked in her/his lifetime, record NO and proceed to Item 1 6. 4. Daily or nearly daily smoking is the criteria  for regular smoking. In those rare insta nces of very low rate smoking, c onsider smoking on most days to be a response indicative of regular smoking. Record the age in years when the participant first started to smoke cigarettes on a daily basis.  Enter  00 if the participant never smoked regularly and proceed to Item 14 . 5. This item determines current use of cigarettes.  If the answer is YES, go to Item 7. 6. The interviewer must calculate the number of months and years since the participant last smok ed cigarettes based on the participants response  Record the number of full months and years since the participant last smoked cigar ettes in the boxes provided in 6a and 6 b. If the respondent has not smoked for 1 -11 months, record number of months using le ading zeros, if needed and \"00\" years.  If >12 months, enter appropriate combination of years and months, using leading zeros as needed.  IF THE PARTICIPANT HAS SMOKED CIGARETTES WITH THE PAST 3 MONTHS, SAY: Please answer the next few questions with regard to your current or recent cigarette smoking practices.  IF THE PARTICIPANT HAS NOT SMOKED CIGARETTES WITHIN THE PAST 3 MONTHS, SAY: Please answer the next few questions with regard to your usual cigarette smoking practices before you quit.  7. A day of sm oking is a 24  hour period, from the time one wakes up until just before waking up the next day. Thus, be sure to count any smoking done during the night (more common in very heavy smokers). For those individuals who have trouble approximating their cigar ette intake, ask for the usual or typical amount. If still difficult, ask how many s/he smoked yesterday, and the day before, and average. Be sure to ask the person if this amount is typical for them. Another approach can be to ask when they bought their  last pack, or last carton (10 packs), consider a daily rate based on how long it takes them to complete the pack.  Record the total number of cigarettes the participant smokes per day.  Record  cigarette as 01.\"  Record any smaller fraction of a cigarette as 00.\"  7a. This question determines if the participants brand of cigarette is/was menthol flavored.  8. This question gets at the notion of nicotine loading, that is, smoking more when one first awakens, in order to get blood nicotine levels up, often seen in heavier smokers. Time of awakening refers to the time at which the participant awakens from her/his longest period of sleeping each day.  For most participants, this will occur in the morning.  Awakening after short napping pe riods should not be cons idered.  9. This item assesses the length of time between awakening and the first cigarette.  Record the appropriate response based on the participants answer. Code the amount of time until the first cigarette is usually smoked. If the participant replies that the time between her/his awakening and her/his smoking varies, ask the participant to estimate the most common time between her/his awakening and her/his smoking. For the participant who has trouble approximating, have the individual briefly describe t heir routine prior to smoking, and then have the participant estimate the amount of time needed for those activities.   10. This item assesses the most difficult cigarette of the day to do without. If participant states \"in the morning,\" when I get up, w ith my coffee or a similar response, clarify. This question is confusing to some individuals, who might answer, for example, with the brand of cigarettes they smoke. Others will have difficulty choosing a particular cigarette, and will respond with severa l preferred smoking times, or say \"all of them.\" Another way to ask the question is, \"if you had one cigarette to smoke during the day, when would you smoke it?\" Be careful not to lead the individual to the \"first of the day\" response. If the person respon ds, \"in the morning,\" have them clarify by asking, \"when in the morning?\"  11. This item gets at the difficulty an individual has abstaining from smoking in an environment where it is forbidden. The specific situation is not the critical component, so you m ay offer other suggestions, such as, \"at a friends house who does not permit smoking,\" \"at work,\" or the like  12. This question addresses the individuals perceived need to smoke even when they are feeling poorly.  Mild illnesses, such as head colds, that do not require the participant to be in bed for most of the day should not be included.  13. This item assesses the usual number of cigarettes per day over the participants entire history of smoking.  It will likely produce the same number given to it em #7  for most participants. However, for those whose daily rates have changed on a relatively permanent basis (for example, unsuccessful at quitting, but has cut back and maintained a reduced rate), this will give us a better long  term estimate of cigarette r ate. Record the average number of whole cigarettes the participant smoked per day.  If the participant is unsure, use similar probes as in question #7 . Record 01 if  cigarette per day; \"00\" for anything else.  14. Years off cigarettes includes only thos e periods during which the participant did not smoke any cigarettes.  A time period in which the participant reduced the number of cigarettes per day should not be included. Add up all those periods of time during which the participant had stopped regular s moking. Subtract this number from the total time since beginning to smoke (Current age minus age when began to smoke regularly).  15. This item assesses depth of inhalation.  READ EACH RESPONSE.  If the participant is unsure, ask for a best guess . 16. This qu estion pertains to the relatively continuous use of any tobacco product other than cigarettes.  Any regular use in dicates the need to ask items 17  28. Regular use, in this case, should be interpreted liberally. Accept any indication of systematic use, eve n if only once every week or so. Some individuals go through phases where they will smoke 2  3 cigars per week, and then none for a while. Derive as accurate an average as you can. If the participant reports no ne or very limited usage of a tobacco product , record No and proceed to Item 29 .   17. This question pertains to regular (see definition in #16) use of cigars or cigarillos.  Subtract age began use from current age, and then subtract any significant periods of time where no ne or very limited  use of this form of tobacco oc curred.   If 00, go to Item 20 . 18. Record the usual number of cigars or cigarillos the participant has smoked per week.  Do not include the number of other tobacco products such as cigarettes or snuff/dip.  19. Record Yes if the pa rticipant CURRENTLY smokes cigars or cigarillos.  Record No otherwise. Current use is defined by the participant.  20. Record the total number of years the participant has smoked a pipe regularly  (see definition in #16) . Subtract age began use from current  age, and then subtract any significant periods of time where no ne or very limited  use of this form of tobacco occurred.  If 00, proceed to Item 23 . 21. Record the usual number of full pipefuls smoked per week by the participant.  22. Record Yes only if the participant CURRENTLY smokes a pipe.  Record No otherwise. Current use is defined by the participant.  23. Record the total number of years in which the participant regularly (see definition in #16) used chewing tobacco. Subtract age began use from cur rent age, and then subtract any significant periods of time where no ne or very limited  use of this form of tobacco occurred. If 00, proceed to Item 26 . 24. A standard pouch contains 3 ounces.  Record the number of 3 ounce pouches the participant has typic ally chewed per week.  25. Record Yes only if the participant is CURRENTLY using chewing tobacco.  Record No otherwise. Current use is defined by the participant.  26. This question pertains to regular (see definition in #16) use of snuff or dip.  Subtract  age began use from current age, and then subtract any significant periods of time where no ne or very limited  use of this form of tobacco occurred.  If 00, go to Item 29. 27. A standard can contains 1.2 ounces.  Record the number of 1.2 -ounce cans that the participant has used per week during the entire period of time s/he has used dip or snuff.  28. Record Yes only if the participant is CURRENTLY using dip or snuff.  Record No otherwise. Current use is defined by the participant.  Go to item 36 after answ ering this question.     TOBACCO USE FOLLOW -UP Questions 29 -35 assess  the participants tobacco use for the past 12 months . These questions  will only be completed if the participant answer ed NO to question 2.  29. This item assesses the participant s tobac co use in the past 12 months . If Yes continue to the next question , If No skip to item 36.  30. This item assesses the number of cigarettes the participant smokes per day  (see question #7) . 30a. This item determines whether or not the preferred brand of  cigarette is menthol flavored  (see question #30a) . 31. This item assesses the length of time between awakening and the first cigarette.  Record the appropriate response based on the parti cipants answer.  Code the amount of time until the first cigarette is  usually smoked.  If the participant replies that the time between her/his awakening and her/his smoking varies, then ask the participant to estimate the most common time between her/his awakening and her/his smoking.  For the participant who has trouble app roximating, have the individual briefly describe their routine prior to smoking, and then have the participant estimate the amount of time needed for those activities.  32.
